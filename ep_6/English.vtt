[The Science of Falling in Love]

01:45.259 --> 01:47.720
[Episode 6]

01:50.330 --> 01:51.320
Su Chengcheng

01:51.890 --> 01:53.170
has been in our lab

01:54.250 --> 01:55.289
for a while

01:55.310 --> 01:56.240
since the beginning of the school year.

01:57.090 --> 01:57.640
Today

01:58.390 --> 01:59.310
according to

01:59.310 --> 02:00.250
the practice of our lab,

02:00.830 --> 02:02.390
we will

02:02.590 --> 02:03.430
decide

02:03.750 --> 02:05.070
whether she can continue to stay

02:05.070 --> 02:06.280
by voting.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.590
Didn't you say there would only be nine people?

02:10.669 --> 02:11.110
Pass them on.

02:11.150 --> 02:12.430
Are the five votes of you still working?

02:12.430 --> 02:13.390
There are so many people.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.670
We usually only have nine.

02:14.750 --> 02:15.950
I don't know what's going on today, either.

02:15.990 --> 02:17.430
Then with so many people here, what should I do?

02:17.430 --> 02:18.350
It's fine. It's fine.

02:18.520 --> 02:18.990
Su Chengcheng.

02:19.630 --> 02:20.470
How can you still think of whispering

02:20.470 --> 02:21.990
at this moment?

02:23.290 --> 02:24.010
Is this funny to you?

02:24.870 --> 02:25.400
No.

02:25.690 --> 02:26.160
How about this?

02:27.070 --> 02:28.260
Please come to the front.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.350
Just stand there.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.170
When I'm counting the votes,

02:39.579 --> 02:40.250
you write them down.

02:47.980 --> 02:49.030
The voting officially begins.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.400
All the votes are collected.

03:21.300 --> 03:21.829
Now, I'll startthe counting.

03:22.950 --> 03:23.670
The first one is

03:24.750 --> 03:25.100
dissen…

03:27.829 --> 03:28.340
Affirmative.

03:32.950 --> 03:35.270
Su Chengcheng has her own thinking,

03:35.430 --> 03:37.079
and can complete her assignment on time.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.329
She does not follow others blindly,

03:38.900 --> 03:40.400
and she's also a good gamer.

03:50.150 --> 03:51.710
The second one is affirmative.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.690
Su Chengcheng is kind

03:56.940 --> 03:57.930
and lively.

03:58.190 --> 04:00.010
She can often liven up

04:00.040 --> 04:01.530
the atmosphere of the lab

04:02.120 --> 04:04.330
and cheer everyone up.

04:10.120 --> 04:10.910
In my opinion,

04:12.200 --> 04:13.480
we come to the lab

04:13.960 --> 04:14.940
to study

04:16.420 --> 04:17.839
and to complete our projects.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.029
We are not here to party,

04:21.570 --> 04:23.030
so what kind of atmosphere do we need to liven up?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.980
And what kind of mood do we need to be cheered up?

04:31.750 --> 04:34.130
It's a dissenting vote. A dissenting vote.

04:36.659 --> 04:38.740
All Su Chengcheng thinks is romance.

04:39.659 --> 04:41.310
Her motivation to come to the lab is not pure.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.230
She only thinks about relationships,

04:43.720 --> 04:44.740
and she's not capable,

04:45.640 --> 04:48.150
so she's not suitable to stay in Brain and Intelligence.

04:51.850 --> 04:54.070
Affirmative. Dissenting. Dissenting.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.820
Affirmative. Dissenting.

04:56.390 --> 04:57.870
Su Chengcheng doesn't know

04:57.909 --> 04:58.600
how to use many of the instruments.

04:59.820 --> 05:00.100
OK.

05:00.870 --> 05:01.530
We've finished counting.

05:01.750 --> 05:02.430
Let's see the results.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.200
It's a tie.

05:09.950 --> 05:11.060
Prof. Du, it's a tie.

05:11.670 --> 05:12.110
Well.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.640
How about you

05:14.670 --> 05:15.520
make an exception and let me stay

05:15.550 --> 05:16.510
for a couple of days so you can observe my performance?

05:19.240 --> 05:20.090
Well...

05:30.900 --> 05:31.790
How come you are so late?

05:34.630 --> 05:35.830
Is Xiao Yuhe

05:35.830 --> 05:36.400
the only one who hasn't voted yet?

05:38.530 --> 05:39.120
How about this?

05:40.020 --> 05:40.870
Let's leave

05:41.280 --> 05:42.390
the casting vote to Xiao Yuhe.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.260
Xiao Yuhe.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.360
Tell us.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.400
Do you agree with Su Chengcheng to stay

05:49.800 --> 05:50.420
or leave?

05:50.750 --> 05:51.120
Prof. Du.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.090
I'll leave.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.580
You don't have to ask him.

05:54.870 --> 05:55.520
Why are you leaving?

05:56.270 --> 05:57.760
What's the problem?

05:58.040 --> 06:00.240
You have to carry everything through to the end.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.050
This isn't the end yet, is it?

06:02.380 --> 06:03.980
And Xiao Yuhe hasn't said anything, right?

06:05.580 --> 06:06.040
Stand up right

06:06.440 --> 06:07.600
and listen to what Xiao Yuhe has to say.

06:08.780 --> 06:09.250
Go ahead.

06:18.110 --> 06:18.990
I agree with her to stay.

06:26.850 --> 06:27.480
So that's an affirmative vote, right?

06:31.000 --> 06:31.740
You are affirmative...

06:32.030 --> 06:32.980
Well, there has to be a reason.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.650
Tell us your reasons.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.680
It is true that

06:39.670 --> 06:40.550
her researching skills are not up to standard

06:40.550 --> 06:41.200
by objective standards.

06:41.430 --> 06:42.570
However, she is only an undergraduate student

06:43.300 --> 06:44.850
and is still in the process of learning the fundamentals.

06:45.590 --> 06:46.350
The specific competencies

06:46.570 --> 06:47.430
can be developed later.

06:48.580 --> 06:49.190
What I

06:49.580 --> 06:50.630
value more

06:50.630 --> 06:51.930
is her underlying driving mechanism,

06:52.390 --> 06:54.050
such as self-doubt, self-iteration,

06:54.590 --> 06:55.310
and curiosity,

06:56.060 --> 06:56.950
which was demonstrated

06:56.950 --> 06:57.909
when doing the romance experiment

06:57.909 --> 06:59.010
with me.

06:59.909 --> 07:00.630
Besides, when I asked her

07:00.630 --> 07:01.510
to clean the electrode caps,

07:01.770 --> 07:02.770
she not only cleaned it

07:03.370 --> 07:04.590
but also sorted

07:04.590 --> 07:05.430
all the relevant equipment.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.560
Moreover,

07:06.590 --> 07:07.370
she's quite patient with Jianming.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.270
Patience is the most important quality in researching.

07:10.490 --> 07:11.660
So I decide to let her stay.

07:18.860 --> 07:19.710
The result is out.

07:20.820 --> 07:21.210
The meeting is over.

07:34.330 --> 07:35.570
I want a cup of bubble tea with half sugar.

07:35.870 --> 07:36.159
OK.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.050
3, 2, 1.

07:55.780 --> 07:58.340
♫A secret has made a decision.♫

07:58.770 --> 08:02.110
♫Tonight, tonight.♫

08:03.090 --> 08:05.920
♫Respond to your sincerity with my heart,♫

08:06.430 --> 08:09.780
♫Alright, alright.♫

08:10.920 --> 08:12.700
♫No matter how far it is,♫

08:12.720 --> 08:14.870
♫Working harder and getting closer.♫

08:15.020 --> 08:18.210
♫My dream, my dream. Hey.♫

08:18.500 --> 08:20.180
♫Meeting you in my youth,♫

08:20.450 --> 08:22.330
♫Planting our promise,♫

08:22.600 --> 08:25.870

08:26.200 --> 08:28.520
♫You support me with your eyes,♫

08:29.920 --> 08:32.400
♫I'm little but I'm brave to try.♫

08:33.400 --> 08:34.990
♫With the best of me,♫

08:44.760 --> 08:49.900
♫Yes OK. Yes OK. Let's go.♫

09:08.020 --> 09:09.480
Cheers.

09:11.740 --> 09:13.010
Now this is the only difficult point,

09:13.200 --> 09:14.560
I think that for the students to grasp it now, it's…

09:16.420 --> 09:16.920
Come in.

09:20.890 --> 09:21.220
Ms. Chen,

09:21.360 --> 09:22.360
you've come back from the academic conference?

09:22.460 --> 09:22.930
Yes.

09:23.270 --> 09:24.720
Prof. Du, these are the papers you asked for.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.150
Then I'll leave.

09:27.440 --> 09:27.970
Wait.

09:28.710 --> 09:29.630
I have something to talk with you.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.120
Tell me.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.350
Why did you let

09:32.350 --> 09:32.890
Su Chengcheng stay?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.160
I said my reasons earlier.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.000
You call those reasons?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.550
If feeding the monkey well

09:41.910 --> 09:43.530
counts as a sign of competence,

09:44.490 --> 09:45.540
then, according to your logic,

09:45.710 --> 09:47.070
we should recruit more zoo keepers

09:47.070 --> 09:47.830
for our lab

09:47.830 --> 09:49.080
in the future.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.030
I'm fine with that.

09:51.120 --> 09:51.940
It's up to you.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.080
Go, go, go. Hurry and leave.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.170
Ms. Chen,

10:01.950 --> 10:03.630
I'm having a headache over this.

10:03.910 --> 10:04.660
I found that

10:04.870 --> 10:06.350
since he met Su Chengcheng,

10:07.070 --> 10:08.350
he's become abnormal.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.300
He is getting stupider every day.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.480
He stood just like he did a moment ago.

10:12.740 --> 10:13.300
Just like this.

10:14.910 --> 10:15.940
Su Chengcheng?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.520
Is she pretty?

10:18.550 --> 10:19.440
No, she isn't.

10:22.710 --> 10:23.910
No, wait,

10:25.670 --> 10:26.150
Ms. Chen,

10:26.150 --> 10:28.430
what did you just say?

10:28.630 --> 10:30.150
I asked you if she's pretty.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.220
You've met her.

10:32.470 --> 10:34.230
She's the girl

10:34.230 --> 10:35.510
who did the romance experiment

10:35.510 --> 10:36.050
with Xiao Yuhe.

10:37.990 --> 10:38.750
She's that girl.

10:38.790 --> 10:39.240
Yes.

10:39.420 --> 10:41.190
I think she's pretty.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.610
Then this romance experiment

10:45.810 --> 10:46.460
is getting interesting.

10:51.790 --> 10:52.430
Chengcheng.

10:52.840 --> 10:53.750
Say, why did Xiao Yuhe

10:53.750 --> 10:55.030
vote for you to stay

10:55.230 --> 10:55.770
in the end?

10:56.470 --> 10:57.400
How shouldI know?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.270
His mind is so difficult to guess.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.430
Say,

11:05.990 --> 11:06.910
could it be that

11:06.910 --> 11:07.930
he still sees me as a tool

11:08.470 --> 11:08.990
and is secretly

11:08.990 --> 11:10.130
trying to do that experiment again?

11:11.960 --> 11:12.910
Then ask him.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.370
I don't want to.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.400
Look,

11:17.420 --> 11:18.910
you have to stay in this lab

11:18.910 --> 11:20.260
at least until finishing your graduation project in your senior year, right?

11:20.820 --> 11:21.400
You have to get along with him

11:21.420 --> 11:22.240
for such a long time.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.830
I think that for a lot of things,

11:24.150 --> 11:25.640
it's better to ask him for clarification.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.630
I'm with Xiaomeng.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.360
You should ask him.

11:31.910 --> 11:32.440
Ask him.

11:33.090 --> 11:33.680
No.

11:34.180 --> 11:34.870
Ask him.

11:36.370 --> 11:37.050
To get things clear.

11:38.710 --> 11:39.100
Do it.

11:44.550 --> 11:45.140
Do it. Do it.

11:52.470 --> 11:53.580
[Xiao Yuhe]

12:05.360 --> 12:06.070
Why did you want me

12:06.070 --> 12:06.870
to stay in the lab?

12:09.470 --> 12:09.950
Do you

12:09.970 --> 12:11.230
have other experiments to do

12:11.460 --> 12:12.230
and want me to

12:12.230 --> 12:13.030
continue being your subject?

12:20.690 --> 12:21.410
He replied.

12:22.510 --> 12:23.020
What did he say?

12:23.020 --> 12:23.600
Let me see.

12:24.340 --> 12:24.980
He recalled it.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.200
What did he say?

12:26.760 --> 12:27.350
"No."

12:29.030 --> 12:29.730
Just a message with two letters?

12:31.110 --> 12:32.390
What's the point of recalling it?

12:33.100 --> 12:33.740
He's typing.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.110
See what he sent.

12:39.170 --> 12:39.870
"No."

12:41.390 --> 12:42.040
What does this mean?

12:42.470 --> 12:42.930
Beats me.

12:43.490 --> 12:44.300
Told you.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.140
His mind is hard to guess.

12:48.650 --> 12:49.140
Chengcheng.

12:49.820 --> 12:51.270
Maybe Xiao Yuhe doesn't hate you.

13:36.630 --> 13:37.820
Then, how about we watch a movie

13:37.820 --> 13:38.660
after dinner?

13:38.700 --> 13:39.460
You bet.

13:39.830 --> 13:41.020
As long as you are happy.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.370
Great.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.680
Our Jiaze is great.

13:43.750 --> 13:44.320
Senior Jiaze.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.020
You are...?

13:50.590 --> 13:51.190
Senior Jiaze.

13:51.190 --> 13:51.890
You don't remember me?

13:52.380 --> 13:53.380
I asked you

13:53.380 --> 13:53.950
several questions

13:54.110 --> 13:55.390
in your last forum,

13:55.580 --> 13:56.670
and you answered them all at that time.

13:59.960 --> 14:00.560
Don't mention it.

14:00.970 --> 14:01.500
Just a piece of cake.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.250
They were a piece of cake for you,

14:04.230 --> 14:04.900
but for me,

14:05.400 --> 14:06.310
your answers have enlightened me a lot.

14:07.190 --> 14:08.210
I've been trying to find an opportunity

14:08.230 --> 14:08.710
to thank you

14:08.750 --> 14:09.630
but haven't found one yet.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.120
I just bought a cup of milk tea,

14:11.230 --> 14:11.910
which I haven't opened yet,

14:12.270 --> 14:13.310
and I've heard that it's a hit on the Internet.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.080
If you don't mind,

14:15.420 --> 14:15.980
I will give it to you.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.500
No, no, you don't have to.

14:16.740 --> 14:17.930
-Just take it.
-Really, you don't have to.

14:18.210 --> 14:18.670
Senior Jiaze, you...

14:19.430 --> 14:19.790
You...

14:20.270 --> 14:21.180
What have you done?

14:21.280 --> 14:21.560
I...

14:22.110 --> 14:22.960
Senior Jiaze, I'm sorry, I...

14:23.470 --> 14:24.860
-I... I didn't mean it, I...
-Tissue papers, do you have tissue papers?

14:25.550 --> 14:26.660
I don't.

14:26.690 --> 14:27.160
Do you have any?

14:27.320 --> 14:28.360
-Me... Me either.
-What’s wrong with you.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.340
I'm really sorry, I...

14:30.180 --> 14:30.980
I've got a class.

14:31.150 --> 14:31.750
I have to go.

14:31.910 --> 14:33.230
Senior Jiaze, please get some tissue papers and clean it with them.

14:33.360 --> 14:33.850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.630
What's the problem with this guy?

14:37.140 --> 14:37.570
Let's go.

14:37.590 --> 14:38.670
Let's head to that restroom

14:38.700 --> 14:39.400
-and clean it up.
-What’s wrong?

14:39.470 --> 14:40.480
Why does he always have trouble with milk tea?

14:41.430 --> 14:43.050
Why is he so annoying?

14:43.650 --> 14:44.530
So disgusting.

14:44.630 --> 14:45.430
Don't let me see him again.

14:45.430 --> 14:45.960
Yeah.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.030
You look so clean and nice,

14:53.140 --> 14:54.400
but why are you so obnoxious?

14:54.710 --> 14:55.550
When you see a guy you like,

14:55.550 --> 14:56.690
will you just try to get close to him?

15:08.730 --> 15:09.540
I have modified

15:09.620 --> 15:11.040
this source code remotely,

15:11.230 --> 15:11.910
please check again.

15:12.060 --> 15:12.450
OK.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.380
Why are you playing games all day?

15:19.460 --> 15:20.650
What do you think about Su Chengcheng?

15:23.820 --> 15:24.620
What do you mean?

15:26.580 --> 15:27.890
I think she's nice.

15:32.750 --> 15:33.900
Haven't I already said that

15:34.940 --> 15:36.250
although her scientific research ability is not strong,

15:36.850 --> 15:37.750
what I value

15:37.780 --> 15:38.980
is her underlying ability?

15:39.060 --> 15:39.950
I think she's nice,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.310
because she plays games for me in the morning.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.310
What are you talking about?

15:57.950 --> 15:59.570
See, Anipop

16:01.080 --> 16:02.650
seems easy,

16:03.980 --> 16:04.690
but

16:05.200 --> 16:07.180
even if you understand its algorithm,

16:07.470 --> 16:08.150
you'll never know

16:08.150 --> 16:08.670
what critter

16:08.670 --> 16:09.640
it will drop next.

16:10.890 --> 16:11.840
It's full of surprise.

16:13.990 --> 16:14.960
I think that

16:15.950 --> 16:16.900
Su Chengcheng

16:16.900 --> 16:18.700
is a surprise like it.

16:20.890 --> 16:21.960
But maybe she's the kind of surprise that makes you happy.

16:24.060 --> 16:24.430
You.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.130
Senior Yuhe,

16:25.790 --> 16:26.510
it seems that

16:26.530 --> 16:27.760
this part still has problems.

16:28.270 --> 16:29.690
It keeps popping weird letters.

16:32.310 --> 16:32.790
OK.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.400
I'll go to the lab and take a look.

16:34.710 --> 16:35.040
OK.

16:42.140 --> 16:43.440
Unbelievable.

16:53.410 --> 16:54.680
Let me tell you, you can't trust

16:55.100 --> 16:55.980
Xie Xiaomeng's words entirely.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.700
Xiao Yuhe has something wrong

16:59.260 --> 17:00.060
with this part of his,

17:00.150 --> 17:00.860
and you can't interpret him

17:00.890 --> 17:02.260
with the logic of normal people.

17:03.260 --> 17:04.950
Chengcheng, I'm looking for you.

17:05.109 --> 17:06.030
Ms. Chen said that

17:06.030 --> 17:06.609
there was a mission for you.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.250
Ms. Chen

17:08.880 --> 17:09.520
has a mission

17:10.109 --> 17:10.790
for me?

17:12.349 --> 17:12.760
By the way,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.460
she asked you to go with Xiao Yuhe.

17:20.630 --> 17:21.310
Your senior

17:21.310 --> 17:22.859
has to come with me for an urgent meeting

17:23.160 --> 17:24.530
and the family baby-sitter is off today,

17:24.859 --> 17:25.640
so the kids are unattended.

17:26.050 --> 17:27.130
This important task

17:27.329 --> 17:28.260
is entrusted to  two of you

17:28.650 --> 17:30.510
and I believe that you will do a good job.

17:43.330 --> 17:43.880
Thank you.

18:22.370 --> 18:23.110
Let's switch places.

19:07.790 --> 19:08.240
Ms. Chen.

19:08.810 --> 19:10.210
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

19:12.770 --> 19:13.450
but I still

19:14.520 --> 19:15.160
can't figure out

19:15.910 --> 19:16.450
one thing.

19:17.180 --> 19:17.510
Go ahead.

19:17.630 --> 19:18.620
Why did you

19:19.150 --> 19:20.440
have to assign

19:20.470 --> 19:21.030
this mission to them

19:21.710 --> 19:23.630
and insist that Su Chengcheng

19:23.630 --> 19:24.600
go with him?

19:25.380 --> 19:27.430
I think that you are kind of wasting

19:27.450 --> 19:29.100
Xiao Yuhe's time.

19:29.410 --> 19:30.370
In my opinion,

19:30.740 --> 19:33.140
Xiao Yuhe's time for experiments

19:33.560 --> 19:35.090
is quite precious.

19:37.180 --> 19:37.670
Du,

19:38.460 --> 19:39.920
have you ever heard of assists?

19:42.820 --> 19:43.290
In soccer.

19:45.790 --> 19:46.300
Volley ball.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.070
Basketball?

19:50.570 --> 19:52.220
Du, really?

19:52.770 --> 19:54.510
H-how come you know nothing about

19:54.710 --> 19:55.910
the modern pop cultures?

19:56.010 --> 19:56.500
What's that?

19:56.690 --> 19:57.920
You really know nothing?

20:01.150 --> 20:01.900
See, Du.

20:02.210 --> 20:02.900
When you have time,

20:03.820 --> 20:05.020
you should talk more

20:05.140 --> 20:05.990
with young people.

20:06.350 --> 20:07.510
You can't

20:07.540 --> 20:08.390
fall behind the times.

20:16.570 --> 20:17.070
Yuhe,

20:17.410 --> 20:18.630
thank you so much for today.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.110
I've just been informed by Ms. Chen

20:20.110 --> 20:21.520
that we'll be leaving for Shanghai on a business trip immediately.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.040
The kids' father

20:23.060 --> 20:23.830
has to work late today

20:23.920 --> 20:24.990
and won't be back until after 10,

20:25.150 --> 20:26.030
so I'll have to ask you

20:26.030 --> 20:26.720
to take care of them for a little while.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.340
Their father will come to pick them up as soon as he gets off work.

20:29.410 --> 20:30.020
OK, senior.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.270
Senior, don't worry.

20:34.270 --> 20:34.800
It's fine.

20:34.940 --> 20:35.550
You can count on us

20:35.590 --> 20:36.440
to take good care of the kids.

20:37.340 --> 20:38.160
That's great.

20:38.590 --> 20:39.960
There are their cups,

20:39.980 --> 20:41.100
snacks,

20:41.230 --> 20:42.350
and some toys in here.

20:42.350 --> 20:42.700
Got it.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.150
I really have to go.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.470
I'll leave Dali and Xiaoli in your hands.

20:45.470 --> 20:45.860
OK.

20:46.430 --> 20:47.410
OK, I'll go.

20:47.430 --> 20:48.100
I have to pack my luggage.

20:48.270 --> 20:48.710
Bye-bye.

20:48.750 --> 20:49.900
Contact me if you have any questions.

20:49.930 --> 20:50.510
-Alright?
-OK.

20:50.820 --> 20:51.770
Good. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

21:03.870 --> 21:05.720
The basic score is 10.

21:10.340 --> 21:13.550
3 combos. 3 times 10.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.020
The base is N.

21:18.390 --> 21:19.340
The multiplier is M.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.030
Hello?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.230
The door won't open?

21:48.660 --> 21:49.350
Please wait a minute.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.050
I'll go downstairs and get it immediately.

21:55.610 --> 21:56.530
Hello, your takeout.

21:56.550 --> 21:57.720
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

22:05.460 --> 22:06.500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:06.810 --> 22:07.660
Senior Xixi?

22:11.460 --> 22:13.310
Gu Chen, why are you here?

22:13.940 --> 22:14.480
I'm...

22:29.620 --> 22:30.400
Take care on your way out.

22:41.690 --> 22:42.550
You look so pretty.

22:43.680 --> 22:44.860
Let's pick a hair clip.

22:46.890 --> 22:48.310
Isn't the watermelon hair clip pretty?

22:49.090 --> 22:50.230
Dali, how about we give your little sister

22:50.260 --> 22:51.390
this watermelon hair clip?

22:53.320 --> 22:53.900
It's ugly.

22:54.020 --> 22:55.440
The watermelon hair clip is lame.

22:55.490 --> 22:56.890
Mom always gives me

22:56.920 --> 22:58.020
the strawberry hair clip.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.080
Is it lame?

23:01.020 --> 23:02.060
We don't have any strawberry hair clips,

23:02.090 --> 23:03.370
so let's just use this watermelon one.

23:03.390 --> 23:04.100
It's so pretty.

23:04.230 --> 23:05.130
I don't want the watermelon.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.290
I want the strawberry.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.710
How about we pick another one?

23:18.780 --> 23:19.980
What's so ugly about this one?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.190
Isn't it pretty? Here.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.800
I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.290
She doesn't want it.

23:28.760 --> 23:29.950
The watermelon hair clip is beautiful.

23:29.990 --> 23:31.730
It looks best on Brother Xiao Yuhe.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.600
Ask him to try it on.

23:32.630 --> 23:32.950
Right.

23:34.890 --> 23:35.720
Why don't you try it on?

23:36.600 --> 23:37.690
It's just for coaxing the kid.

23:43.980 --> 23:45.010
See how pretty it is.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.020
Do you want it?

23:46.360 --> 23:47.110
If you don't,

23:47.130 --> 23:47.920
I'll give it to him.

23:48.150 --> 23:49.880
No, I want the watermelon hair clip.

23:49.910 --> 23:51.280
I'm the prettiest one wearing it.

23:51.550 --> 23:52.430
You're the prettiest one wearing it.

23:52.460 --> 23:53.430
Then hurry and give it back to us.

23:53.430 --> 23:53.750
Here you are.

23:53.870 --> 23:54.560
Give it back to us.

23:54.730 --> 23:55.460
Let's wear it now

23:55.490 --> 23:56.160
so no one can snatch it from us.

23:56.190 --> 23:56.830
Boring.

24:07.150 --> 24:07.780
Let me see.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.500
You are the prettiest one wearing it.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.050
You look so good.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.220
A Rubik's Cube.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.710
Let's wear another one on this side.

24:25.620 --> 24:26.050
It's done.

24:27.080 --> 24:27.570
Brother,

24:27.590 --> 24:29.360
can you teach me?

24:32.680 --> 24:33.260
Of course.

24:38.330 --> 24:39.840
Wash your hands.

24:39.970 --> 24:41.910
Wash your hands and make the gifts.

24:41.990 --> 24:42.630
Have you made up your mind

24:42.630 --> 24:43.440
on what to make for your mom?

24:45.060 --> 24:45.610
Senior Yuhe,

24:46.070 --> 24:47.300
the model we made before

24:47.340 --> 24:48.410
has been reporting data errors.

24:48.590 --> 24:49.810
Could you go there and take a look?

24:50.870 --> 24:52.520
I need to go, call me if you need anything.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.070
OK.

24:56.530 --> 24:57.500
This hand is clean.

25:02.350 --> 25:04.030
Both of the paws are clean.

25:23.430 --> 25:25.830
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.800
Done. All clean.

25:26.990 --> 25:27.940
Come with your big brother.

25:31.190 --> 25:31.740
Dali.

25:33.260 --> 25:33.970
Dali?

25:40.510 --> 25:41.590
Ms. Chen is the only one

25:41.590 --> 25:42.550
who knows the password of her office.

25:42.550 --> 25:43.710
The problem is that she and our senior

25:43.710 --> 25:44.970
have gone to a confidential meeting in Shanghai

25:45.280 --> 25:46.370
and are on the plane right now,

25:46.390 --> 25:47.130
so we can't reach her by phone.

25:47.350 --> 25:48.770
I think it will be a few more hours

25:49.030 --> 25:50.110
before we can get through to her.

25:55.450 --> 25:59.220
It's so dark. I'm afraid of the dark.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.720
Chengcheng, where are you going?

26:03.620 --> 26:04.950
Dali, don't cry.

26:07.630 --> 26:08.560
Dali, don't cry.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.210
I'll find a way to get you out.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.290
Come on, Dongmao, move a bit.

26:17.550 --> 26:18.030
No.

26:18.150 --> 26:18.950
It's too dangerous for a kid

26:18.950 --> 26:19.390
to be alone in there.

26:19.420 --> 26:20.210
I'll remove the door.

26:22.120 --> 26:22.660
Let me see.

26:27.940 --> 26:29.440
Wait, do you know the password?

26:31.800 --> 26:32.600
I have a rough idea

26:33.670 --> 26:34.960
of the pattern of Ms. Chen's password setting.

26:36.020 --> 26:36.410
Well,

26:36.630 --> 26:38.500
if you make three wrong entries,

26:38.520 --> 26:39.590
it will automatically lock from the inside.

26:40.710 --> 26:41.590
But we have to try, right?

26:42.380 --> 26:43.710
Go ahead, go ahead.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.980
It's so dark. I'm afraid of the dark.

27:10.870 --> 27:12.110
Don't be afraid. Miss Chengcheng is coming.

27:20.310 --> 27:21.150
It's unlocked.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.190
Come here, Dali.

27:23.870 --> 27:24.460
It's alright now.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.370
The windows in this room are sealed.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.400
There's none.

27:33.550 --> 27:35.270
I just wanted to take this

27:35.270 --> 27:36.930
as a gift for Mom.

27:38.790 --> 27:39.790
It's fine. It's fine.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.250
Chengcheng.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.130
Don't look down. Don't look down.

27:45.740 --> 27:46.790
Yuhe is coming.

27:49.430 --> 27:49.940
No, no, no.

27:49.970 --> 27:50.550
No, no, no.

27:50.550 --> 27:51.430
Yuhe is coming to save you.

27:51.450 --> 27:52.070
Yuhe is here.

27:57.550 --> 27:57.930
Come here.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.360
It's too high.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.310
I haven't noticed it when coming.

28:01.330 --> 28:03.280
Now I can't get across.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.430
D-don't stand on the edge.

28:05.430 --> 28:07.200
-It's too dangerous.
-Come over, I'll catch you.

29:09.190 --> 29:10.110
Hey, Yuhe.

29:10.610 --> 29:12.320
How about you two come down first and then hug?

29:16.070 --> 29:16.960
Be careful. Be careful.

29:23.270 --> 29:24.190
Come here, be slow.

29:24.750 --> 29:25.590
Be slow. Be slow.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.100
It's all my fault today.

29:48.940 --> 29:49.970
I didn't keep an eye on Dali.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.230
I let him stay by himself in that small dark room

29:52.230 --> 29:53.210
for such a long time.

29:53.870 --> 29:54.990
He must be scared.

30:00.350 --> 30:01.630
Aren't you quick to step up

30:01.630 --> 30:02.390
and protect them?

30:06.790 --> 30:07.690
You have done well.

30:21.630 --> 30:22.940
Let me make them a gift.

30:23.410 --> 30:24.470
I'll give it to them when they wake up.

31:20.550 --> 31:21.190
How did you know

31:21.190 --> 31:22.130
I want to draw a flashlight?

31:24.130 --> 31:25.090
How come you know how to make this?

31:28.420 --> 31:29.990
I've read about it

31:29.990 --> 31:30.580
in a magazine before.

31:30.860 --> 31:31.700
What magazine?

31:31.990 --> 31:33.050
Only a few people know how to make this.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.150
It's been a long time.

31:34.150 --> 31:34.850
I don't remember.

31:41.950 --> 31:43.410
Could it be that someone has taught you how to do it?

31:44.950 --> 31:45.900
Have we met before?

31:48.570 --> 31:49.390
Haven't you said that

31:49.860 --> 31:50.700
if you ever met me before,

31:50.700 --> 31:51.880
you definitely would have recognized me?

31:56.560 --> 31:57.420
I'm sure we never met before.

32:19.510 --> 32:20.390
This toy

32:20.390 --> 32:21.550
is called the Amazing Flashlight.

32:21.670 --> 32:22.830
It's made by this mister.

32:23.310 --> 32:23.900
See,

32:24.110 --> 32:25.470
put in this flashlight,

32:25.510 --> 32:28.040
and the light will come out.

32:28.830 --> 32:29.820
I played with this too when I was little.

32:30.110 --> 32:30.630
It's yours.

32:31.360 --> 32:31.640
Quick.

32:31.670 --> 32:32.470
-Dali, you take it.
-Hold it.

32:33.180 --> 32:34.380
Then you'll not be afraid of the dark.

32:34.820 --> 32:35.910
Thank you, miss.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.940
Thank you for your effort today.

32:38.230 --> 32:38.690
It's fine.

32:39.390 --> 32:40.380
We like them a lot as well.

32:40.850 --> 32:42.050
Mr. Xiao Yuhe.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.620
This is for you and Miss Chengcheng.

32:45.030 --> 32:45.510
Thanks.

32:46.000 --> 32:46.760
Thank you.

32:46.890 --> 32:47.510
Alright.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.240
Say goodbye to the mister and miss.

32:49.330 --> 32:49.890
Let's go home.

32:50.350 --> 32:50.990
Bye-bye.

32:50.990 --> 32:51.670
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.

32:51.670 --> 32:52.430
Bye-bye.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.520
Thank you. Thank you. Let's go.

33:00.300 --> 33:01.600
Senior, there's a cut on your hand.

33:04.430 --> 33:05.280
If you say that later,

33:05.320 --> 33:06.020
it will heal.

33:07.590 --> 33:10.150
Thank you for voting me

33:10.260 --> 33:11.060
today.

33:12.070 --> 33:12.590
Don't mention it.

33:14.510 --> 33:15.480
Why did you let me stay?

33:17.270 --> 33:17.950
Haven't I said this

33:17.950 --> 33:18.750
when voting?

33:19.110 --> 33:20.480
You have strong emotional perception

33:20.830 --> 33:21.600
and fair technical skills,

33:22.060 --> 33:23.000
which will be useful in future work.

33:24.780 --> 33:25.860
You complemented me.

33:29.210 --> 33:30.140
Take this.

33:31.190 --> 33:32.230
You have the most credit today.

33:32.480 --> 33:32.950
Thank you for your effort.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.400
Su Chengcheng. Su Chengcheng.

34:25.290 --> 34:26.850
Zhu Panpan, is that you?

34:26.880 --> 34:27.590
Zhu Panpan?

34:28.030 --> 34:28.780
Yes, it's me.

34:37.310 --> 34:37.969
Su Chengcheng,

34:38.659 --> 34:40.070
why is your homeso dark?

34:40.420 --> 34:42.070
Dad has suddenly fallen ill

34:42.310 --> 34:43.880
and Mom is taking him to the hospital.

34:44.830 --> 34:46.230
Now the power is out.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.219
It's dark here. I'm scared.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.230
How did you know

34:50.230 --> 34:51.130
I want to draw a flashlight?

34:51.500 --> 34:53.010
I've read about it

34:53.030 --> 34:53.659
in a magazine before.

34:53.989 --> 34:54.820
I was afraid of the dark

34:55.510 --> 34:56.310
when I was a kid,

34:56.909 --> 34:58.560
and he conjured up the Amazing Flashlight.

34:59.270 --> 35:01.310
It lights up. It really does.

35:01.410 --> 35:02.490
It's amazing.

35:02.890 --> 35:04.170
It lit up my room,

35:04.910 --> 35:06.150
and also my life.

35:06.180 --> 35:06.930
You drew so well.

35:07.150 --> 35:11.470
♫The more we get together,♫

35:07.660 --> 35:08.340
Su Chengcheng,

35:08.610 --> 35:09.930
do you not know this one?

35:10.180 --> 35:11.120
Let me explain it to you.

35:11.710 --> 35:15.930
♫Together, together.♫

35:12.150 --> 35:13.250

35:14.990 --> 35:16.110
Let's solve them together in the future.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.800
♫The more we get together,♫

35:16.290 --> 35:17.400
6, 7.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.560
Are you still not understanding it?

35:19.670 --> 35:21.360
He would go to great lengths

35:20.800 --> 35:25.230
♫The happier we'll be.♫

35:21.390 --> 35:22.470
to explain all the math problems to me

35:22.630 --> 35:23.870
and would share his favourite things

35:23.870 --> 35:24.430
with me.

35:24.430 --> 35:25.530
It’s really 16.

35:25.790 --> 35:26.710
Where did you buy these?

35:26.740 --> 35:27.890
I want a set, too.

35:27.610 --> 35:31.870
♫For your friends are my friends,♫

35:28.310 --> 35:30.030

♫And my friends are your friends.♫

35:51.650 --> 35:53.050

35:54.510 --> 35:56.090
that we'll do together in the future.

36:38.830 --> 36:39.470
Miss,

36:39.900 --> 36:41.800
why didn't Zhu Panpan come to school today?

36:42.840 --> 36:43.640
Zhu Panpan?

36:43.950 --> 36:44.870
He has transferred to another school

36:44.870 --> 36:45.980
to study elsewhere.

36:46.490 --> 36:47.220
He has transferred to another school?

36:48.230 --> 36:49.030
Why didn't he tell me

36:49.060 --> 36:50.430
about such a big thing?

36:51.470 --> 36:52.470
I ran to his house

36:52.470 --> 36:53.340
and wanted to ask him.

36:53.630 --> 36:54.230
But I found that

36:54.230 --> 36:55.520
it was already empty.

36:55.660 --> 36:58.670
Zhu Panpan. Zhu Panpan.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.440
Zhu Panpan.

37:02.460 --> 37:03.070
Zhu Panpan.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.250
Zhu Panpan.

37:05.190 --> 37:07.480
Zhu Panpan, are you still home?

37:07.500 --> 37:08.300
Zhu Panpan.

37:08.590 --> 37:09.390
Zhu Panpan.

37:09.390 --> 37:09.980
Zhu Panpan.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.230
Zhu Panpan, are you home?

37:11.230 --> 37:11.980
Zhu Panpan.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.530
Zhu Panpan, come out.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.880
Zhu Panpan. Zhu Panpan.

37:15.910 --> 37:16.970
Zhu Panpan. Get out.

37:18.030 --> 37:20.250
Zhu Panpan. Hurry and get out.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.840
Zhu Panpan.

37:24.380 --> 37:25.490
Zhu Panpan.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.040
Hurry up and get out.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.800
Su Chengcheng. It's already late.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.310
Let's go home.

37:48.510 --> 37:48.950
No.

37:49.070 --> 37:50.620
Zhu Panpan will definitely come back.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.880
I'm going to show him

37:51.910 --> 37:53.170
my sticks.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.160
Su Chengcheng, don't cry.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.370
Zhu Panpan left without telling you.

37:58.790 --> 38:00.270
He didn't see you as his friend at all.

38:03.670 --> 38:04.440
Maybe

38:05.270 --> 38:06.860
he just had something

38:07.460 --> 38:08.980
that took him away temporarily for a few days;

38:09.780 --> 38:10.460
maybe

38:10.870 --> 38:11.790
he was delayed by something

38:11.790 --> 38:13.020
on the way back;

38:14.170 --> 38:14.940
maybe...

38:23.850 --> 38:25.160
Although he left without saying goodbye,

38:26.440 --> 38:27.480
I didn't give up.

38:28.550 --> 38:29.890
I kept writing emails to him,

38:30.740 --> 38:31.910
expecting

38:32.420 --> 38:33.580
to hear from him one day.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.370
But after all these years have passed,

38:41.220 --> 38:43.120
those emails all went unanswered.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.250
I finally had to come to terms with that

38:47.620 --> 38:49.300
all those years of missing

38:51.410 --> 38:53.100
were just a one-man show for me.

39:30.830 --> 39:32.380
Those fond memories of the past

39:32.410 --> 39:33.650
had become evidence of my naivety.

39:35.950 --> 39:37.070
So I decided to

39:37.070 --> 39:37.820
delete them all.

39:39.550 --> 39:40.910
It's as if forgetting Zhu Panpan

39:42.550 --> 39:43.510
could erase myself

39:43.510 --> 39:44.640
that was afraid of loneliness.

39:46.990 --> 39:47.740
This is for you.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.430
Take it and you'll also be

39:49.450 --> 39:50.950
my best, best friend.

39:52.670 --> 39:53.860
Zhu Panpan, is that you?

39:54.100 --> 39:54.860
Yes, it's me.
