02:02.140 --> 02:02.710
No!

02:03.140 --> 02:03.970
In such a quiz,

02:03.970 --> 02:05.410
the seats are arranged according to the student number.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.830
I can only count on you.

02:09.850 --> 02:10.470
Me?

02:11.780 --> 02:13.170
Are you crazy?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.340
I don't even believe in myself.

02:14.340 --> 02:15.180
How can you count on me?

02:16.160 --> 02:17.329
What to do?

02:18.200 --> 02:19.680
You’d better

02:19.700 --> 02:20.800
review for a while.

02:20.910 --> 02:21.680
Make as much effort as possible

02:21.700 --> 02:22.870
at the last moment.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.329
Put the books away.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.990
Get ready for the exam.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.140
Good luck to you.

Those in front pass the papers.

04:22.160 --> 04:22.990
Which one?

04:23.980 --> 04:24.980
The last two questions.

04:28.870 --> 04:29.390
I didn’t answer them.

04:31.100 --> 04:31.930
You did.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.780
I don’t know.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.280
What?

04:36.840 --> 04:37.690
I don’t care.

04:40.630 --> 04:41.540
Come on.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.420

The one in blue.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.640
She said she doesn’t know.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.550
Can't you hear her

04:56.890 --> 04:57.830
talking so loudly?

05:04.790 --> 05:05.550
How about you ask me?

05:05.910 --> 05:06.480
Of course I know.

05:20.610 --> 05:21.240
Chengcheng.

05:21.910 --> 05:23.040
Will our scores

05:23.060 --> 05:24.420

05:29.210 --> 05:29.800
I’ll ask.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.490
Will our test scores

05:38.490 --> 05:39.390
be canceled?

05:40.280 --> 05:41.560
You'll know when the results come out.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.260
It would be too late.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.600
Could you tell me now?

05:46.130 --> 05:46.760

usually came to invigilate the exam.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.990
Why are you here today?

05:55.200 --> 05:55.720
Is it because

05:55.750 --> 05:56.620
today is my exam,

05:56.620 --> 05:58.050
so you came here on purpose to make fun of me?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.870
It was my mistake

06:02.090 --> 06:03.300
to confess to you before, sorry.

06:03.650 --> 06:04.650
You did the experiment

06:04.680 --> 06:05.590
and played a trick on me.

06:05.620 --> 06:06.850
What else do you want me to do?

06:17.280 --> 06:17.890
Come on.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.480
Are you okay?

06:24.850 --> 06:25.920
Man, are you okay?

06:26.740 --> 06:27.250
I’m fine.

06:27.250 --> 06:27.850
I will help you.

06:27.850 --> 06:28.260

You should go.

06:48.650 --> 06:49.570
It’s okay. He can make it myself.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.340
You should go.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.700
We are leaving then.

06:51.980 --> 06:52.460
Do me a favor.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.200
Give me a hand.

07:00.240 --> 07:00.620
Thank you.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.840

08:16.690 --> 08:17.300
Did she agree?

08:17.490 --> 08:18.490
Of course.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.120
She’s so happy.

08:20.340 --> 08:20.830
Really?

08:21.270 --> 08:21.830
Then what?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.040
Then I gave her

08:23.070 --> 08:23.580
both tickets.

08:23.780 --> 08:24.540
I just want her to be proud

08:24.540 --> 08:26.260
in front of her roommates.

08:26.460 --> 08:27.250
You gave her both?

08:28.230 --> 08:29.580
Dongmao, seriously...

08:30.170 --> 08:31.410
Your emotional intelligence

08:31.410 --> 08:32.289
is so high.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.159

What video? I didn’t see it.

You scared me.

10:27.850 --> 10:28.580
You scared me.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.060
Don't just think about

10:31.060 --> 10:32.420

How can you have bread for breakfast?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.260
It’s bad for your health.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.780
Insufficient protein intake

11:49.790 --> 11:50.190
Take a try.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.300
Junior Chengcheng.

11:53.340 --> 11:53.830
You scare me

11:53.930 --> 11:55.970
like this.

11:58.330 --> 11:59.340
Prof. Du asked everyone

11:59.370 --> 12:00.980
to vote on whether I can stay

12:01.010 --> 12:02.330
this Friday.

12:03.820 --> 12:04.700
After thinking about it,

12:04.740 --> 12:05.870
I feel that the possibility

12:05.900 --> 12:06.370
of me staying

12:06.390 --> 12:07.490
is really slim.

12:08.870 --> 12:10.250
So I decided to change tack.

12:10.580 --> 12:11.990
I want to do better

12:12.010 --> 12:12.820

12:12.820 --> 12:14.370

12:14.950 --> 12:15.900
In this way, my chances of success

Do you think it will work?

12:23.700 --> 12:24.330
Chengcheng.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.920
It's okay to do good.

12:26.020 --> 12:26.570
But you don’t have to

12:26.600 --> 12:27.320
be humble.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.500
With me here,

12:28.500 --> 12:29.050
what are you afraid of?

12:29.250 --> 12:30.510
I will definitely vote for you.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.790
It's useless for you alone to vote for me.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.150
There are so many people in the laboratory.

12:36.430 --> 12:37.210
You have one vote.

12:41.690 --> 12:42.660
Although there are quite a few people

12:42.660 --> 12:43.330
in the laboratory,

12:43.510 --> 12:45.000
only these nine people

12:45.020 --> 12:45.790
generally participate in the voting.

12:45.980 --> 12:46.990
As long as you get more than half of the votes,

12:47.240 --> 12:48.110
you can stay.

As long as I can get

12:58.010 --> 12:58.810
these five votes for you,

12:59.080 --> 13:00.310
you can stay.

You are really

13:06.800 --> 13:07.520
my true friend.

Now what I am your true friend,

13:10.100 --> 13:11.490
could you grant me

13:11.490 --> 13:12.630

13:13.110 --> 13:13.780
What wish?

13:18.120 --> 13:19.510
Send me Xiao's video.

13:31.830 --> 13:32.790

appreciate it with ease.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.640
What are you watching?

13:50.150 --> 13:50.740
I...

13:50.900 --> 13:53.530
We are talking about learning.

13:53.960 --> 13:54.450
Show me.

14:01.230 --> 14:02.090
It’s none of your business.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.660
It's almost time to vote.

14:10.740 --> 14:11.950
What should I do?

14:12.090 --> 14:12.890

to find your own value.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.240
If you have nothing to do today,

14:17.260 --> 14:18.220
go to the monkey house

14:18.260 --> 14:19.530
to collect some data for Prof. Du.

14:20.180 --> 14:21.250
This is the experiment code.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.380
Just follow it.

14:22.590 --> 14:24.310
There are monkeys in our lab?

14:24.380 --> 14:25.380
Of course.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.070
The neurons of monkeys

14:27.090 --> 14:28.170
are very similar to those

14:28.170 --> 14:28.700
of human beings,

14:28.720 --> 14:30.360
so the research objects

14:30.390 --> 14:31.170
are always monkeys.

14:32.450 --> 14:32.960
Okay.

14:35.420 --> 14:35.870
By the way,

14:36.700 --> 14:37.930
The monkey in the laboratory

14:37.960 --> 14:38.650
is named Jianming,

14:39.390 --> 14:40.870
very smart and lively.

14:40.900 --> 14:41.540
Be careful

14:41.560 --> 14:42.690
when you come into contact

14:43.850 --> 14:44.550
with it.

14:45.850 --> 14:47.230
-Okay.
-Remember to ask me

14:47.260 --> 14:47.900
if you have any question.

14:47.900 --> 14:48.540
Okay.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.260
Here comes

14:59.520 --> 15:00.460
the opportunity to show my personal value.

15:03.340 --> 15:04.460
She will not fall in love with you.

15:18.630 --> 15:19.640
Hello.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.530
Are you Jianming?

15:23.940 --> 15:25.100
You can even stand up.

15:27.150 --> 15:28.470
Hello, Jianming.

15:28.490 --> 15:29.470
My name is Su Chengcheng.

15:31.040 --> 15:31.980
So cute.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.020
What are you doing?

15:33.490 --> 15:34.290
Watching cartoons?

15:35.330 --> 15:35.930
Is it fun?

15:41.600 --> 15:42.360
Have a banana.

15:54.890 --> 15:56.140
How can you snatch the key?

16:12.170 --> 16:13.040
Senior Jiafa.

16:13.550 --> 16:14.880
I haven't been here for a few days,

16:15.210 --> 16:17.270
and there is a newcomer in our lab?

16:18.430 --> 16:19.620
An undergraduate junior.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.930
Why does our lab

16:23.960 --> 16:25.250
accept undergraduates?

16:26.250 --> 16:27.890
Does she have good grades?

16:28.730 --> 16:29.280
Not really.

16:29.490 --> 16:30.450
Then why?

16:31.170 --> 16:32.690
She confessed to Xiao.

16:32.760 --> 16:33.360
And Xiao

16:33.380 --> 16:34.320
recruited her to the lab.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.370
Really?

16:39.220 --> 16:42.850
Does senior Xiao like her?

16:44.690 --> 16:46.240
I don’t understand.

16:46.260 --> 16:47.030
It’s complicated.

16:47.530 --> 16:48.640
I’m not good at this.

16:51.510 --> 16:51.950
Xiao.

16:52.570 --> 16:53.000
Data.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.310
Thanks.

17:01.700 --> 17:02.220
Senior.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.010
These are the medical records

17:04.030 --> 17:05.430
I collected in the First Affiliated Hospital

17:05.550 --> 17:06.750
in the past few days.

17:07.170 --> 17:07.849
Take a look.

17:09.060 --> 17:09.480
By the way,

17:09.890 --> 17:11.760
I got my thesis review comments.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.260
But I still don't understand

17:14.260 --> 17:15.079
some places,

17:15.890 --> 17:16.660
and I don't know

17:16.660 --> 17:17.859
if my understanding is correct.

17:18.900 --> 17:19.660
Could you

17:19.690 --> 17:20.619
take a look for me?

17:21.260 --> 17:21.660
Okay.

17:22.910 --> 17:23.599
Thank you, senior.

17:23.880 --> 17:24.869
I'll email you in a moment.

17:30.890 --> 17:31.350
Anything else?

17:33.490 --> 17:36.210
I heard that you recruited

17:36.310 --> 17:37.540
a new undergraduate junior.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.340
Why didn’t I see her?

17:44.040 --> 17:45.040
Well...

17:45.520 --> 17:46.780
I sent her to the monkey house.

17:47.730 --> 17:48.760
I’m in charge

17:48.940 --> 17:49.760
of the work

17:49.790 --> 17:50.850
in the monkey house.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.630
She wasn’t trained,

17:52.920 --> 17:54.140
so she can’t make it at all.

17:57.330 --> 17:58.660
I think she's smart.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.140
If she is inexperienced, help her more.

18:05.330 --> 18:05.770
Okay.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.220
I’m going to help her.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.210
Dongmao.

18:22.570 --> 18:23.560
How could you send her directly

18:23.590 --> 18:24.930
to the monkey house?

18:26.450 --> 18:27.370
Well, I...

18:28.440 --> 18:30.120
I saw she had nothing to do,

18:30.320 --> 18:31.570
so I let her go.

18:41.940 --> 18:42.740
Jianming.

18:44.230 --> 18:46.050
Let me tell you

18:46.050 --> 18:46.940
one last time.

18:47.050 --> 18:48.180
Spit out

18:48.180 --> 18:49.140
the key now.

18:52.080 --> 18:52.790
Listen.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.560
I also have a bad temper.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.560
If you give me the key,

18:59.580 --> 19:00.490
we'll be even.

19:01.370 --> 19:01.700
Here.

19:10.730 --> 19:11.800
Are you Su Chengcheng?

19:12.380 --> 19:13.680
How could you

19:13.710 --> 19:14.770
let Jianming out?

19:16.590 --> 19:17.250
Senior.

19:18.310 --> 19:19.260
It was Jianming

19:19.260 --> 19:20.590
who snatched the key in my basket

19:20.620 --> 19:21.500
and came out by himself,

19:21.500 --> 19:23.060
not me.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.150
Sorry, senior.

19:28.240 --> 19:28.740
Su Chengcheng.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.050
Now

19:31.470 --> 19:32.150
put Jianming inside.

19:33.020 --> 19:34.500
I’m working on it.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.100
Senior.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.030
Go back.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.790
Go back.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.000
Get in.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.610
It hits me, so I’m afraid.

19:50.150 --> 19:50.680
What’s this?

19:54.740 --> 19:55.500
Screw.

19:57.750 --> 19:58.630
Bingo.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.240
It’s a screw.

20:01.300 --> 20:01.810
And

20:02.610 --> 20:05.020
it's a screw coming out

20:05.050 --> 20:06.300
of poor Jianming's mouth.

20:07.910 --> 20:09.370
It’s okay that

20:09.730 --> 20:11.080
you didn’t do a good job.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.960
But how can you cause Jianming

20:12.990 --> 20:13.900
to eat the screw?

20:15.470 --> 20:16.090
Listen.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.810
Fortunately, he spit it out.

20:18.230 --> 20:19.430
If not,

20:19.620 --> 20:20.420
do you know how serious

20:20.420 --> 20:21.800
the consequences would be?

20:22.490 --> 20:23.540
Do you know

20:24.280 --> 20:25.580
how much energy

20:25.580 --> 20:27.150
and effort

20:28.040 --> 20:29.710
it takes

20:30.350 --> 20:31.500
to raise an experimental monkey?

20:34.300 --> 20:35.100
Sorry, professor.

20:35.140 --> 20:36.300
I didn’t do it on purpose.

20:36.430 --> 20:38.110
I don't know why Jianming

20:38.140 --> 20:39.050
suddenly reached out

20:39.050 --> 20:40.330
and took the key away.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.150
Chengcheng.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.300
You got me wrong.

20:45.070 --> 20:45.930
I didn't call you here

20:46.120 --> 20:47.580
to listen to your explanation.

20:48.890 --> 20:50.420
We're about to vote for you.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.530
You better be mentally prepared

20:52.940 --> 20:53.680
and conduct yourself well.

21:05.210 --> 21:05.590
Xixi.

21:09.720 --> 21:10.370
Senior Xixi.

21:11.010 --> 21:11.770
Would you like some coffee?

21:13.660 --> 21:14.380
There is a new coffee shop

21:14.410 --> 21:15.500
near the school,

21:15.500 --> 21:16.820
and the pour-over coffee there tastes good.

21:16.970 --> 21:18.050
I packed one for you.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.000
Would you like to try it?

21:19.220 --> 21:20.450
I don’t drink coffee, thank you.

21:22.100 --> 21:22.960
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.620
I bought sandwiches and milk.

21:24.770 --> 21:26.160
If you want Chinese food, I have tofu jelly.

21:28.290 --> 21:28.960
I’ve had breakfast.

21:43.590 --> 21:44.080
Xixi.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.270
Prof. Du said that this Friday,

21:47.570 --> 21:49.710
the members in the lab will vote on

21:49.740 --> 21:51.260
whether I can stay.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.660
Could you vote for me?

21:54.660 --> 21:55.900
No, no, no.

22:06.490 --> 22:07.380
Don't go there.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.740
Go ahead

22:08.740 --> 22:09.420
after the hairball passes.

22:14.650 --> 22:15.130
Sorry.

22:21.310 --> 22:21.830
This one.

22:22.020 --> 22:22.350
Yes.

22:22.720 --> 22:23.220
There is

22:23.550 --> 22:24.840
a special effect prop below.

22:37.240 --> 22:37.940
Let me.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.250
You have to grasp the core,

22:42.930 --> 22:44.180
find out the key,

22:44.530 --> 22:46.030
and figure out the changes

22:48.400 --> 22:49.060
on the board.

22:49.830 --> 22:50.850
And you can pass easily.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.460
Look, here is the prop.

22:54.100 --> 22:54.580
Pass!

22:57.490 --> 22:58.000
Sorry.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.050
I didn’t do it on purpose.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.040
I won’t do this again.

23:00.070 --> 23:00.570
I’m leaving.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.480
I won't bother you anymore.

23:05.230 --> 23:06.190
I will vote for you.

23:06.950 --> 23:07.470
Really?

23:08.830 --> 23:09.800
Thank you, senior.

23:10.730 --> 23:11.780
Do you need any more help?

23:35.800 --> 23:36.380
Su Chengcheng.

23:36.700 --> 23:37.340
How many people

23:37.340 --> 23:38.280
have you shown my videos to?

23:47.490 --> 23:48.140
Take a guess?

23:54.680 --> 23:55.890
Senior Zhang Li.

23:57.090 --> 23:58.220
I bought one milk tea

23:58.220 --> 23:59.120
and got one free.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.140
Try if it tastes good.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.350
-Okay.
-I will open it for you.

24:02.450 --> 24:02.850
Thank you.

24:06.090 --> 24:07.280
Xiao, Prof. Du is looking for you.

24:07.440 --> 24:07.770
I...

24:09.180 --> 24:10.290
Drink less milk tea.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.280
It's too sweet.

24:11.570 --> 24:12.270
It's sugar-free.

24:14.930 --> 24:16.200
I'd better go get a cup of coffee.

24:22.920 --> 24:23.770
Good.

24:25.010 --> 24:26.780
After the algorithm iteration this time,

24:26.940 --> 24:28.060
the recognition accuracy rate

24:28.060 --> 24:29.440
has increased by more than 20%.

24:31.050 --> 24:32.970
The editors of several core journals

24:33.330 --> 24:34.390
are asking me.

24:36.130 --> 24:37.620
Sort it out

24:38.290 --> 24:39.450
and send it as soon as possible.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.440
Okay, I see.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.350
Xiao Yuhe.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.930
I watched the video

24:52.250 --> 24:53.480
of you falling.

24:54.310 --> 24:55.640
Is your waist okay?

24:58.170 --> 24:58.790
I’m fine.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.500
My waist is fine.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.420
Has anything

25:03.020 --> 25:04.380
happened recently?

25:05.020 --> 25:06.270
No, nothing.

25:06.540 --> 25:07.090
All going well.

25:07.410 --> 25:08.010
Are you sure?

25:08.030 --> 25:08.500
Yes.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.530
Prof. Du, I will leave you alone.

25:12.810 --> 25:13.280
Hold on.

25:18.460 --> 25:20.260
[Pain-relieving Patch]

25:19.640 --> 25:20.010
Here you are,

25:21.830 --> 25:22.400
Take it.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.330
How about I apply it
for you now?

25:30.680 --> 25:31.520
No need.

25:31.620 --> 25:32.300
I’m leaving.

25:32.300 --> 25:32.810
It’s okay.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.200
No need.

25:33.220 --> 25:33.590
I...

25:42.580 --> 25:43.730
I have two tickets

25:43.730 --> 25:44.810
for the weekend premiere.

25:44.970 --> 25:45.610
Would you like

25:45.610 --> 25:46.420
to watch with me?

25:46.850 --> 25:47.380
How is it?

25:47.660 --> 25:48.500
No problem.

25:48.710 --> 25:49.530
Seize the opportunity

25:50.150 --> 25:50.930
while there are few people now.

25:51.490 --> 25:51.930
Go.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.250
Come on.

25:56.610 --> 25:57.330
Senior Xixi.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.440
What’s up?

26:00.250 --> 26:01.340
Well, I know

26:01.370 --> 26:03.270
you like science fiction films.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.500
I have two tickets

26:05.690 --> 26:06.880
for the weekend premiere.

26:07.330 --> 26:08.610
Would you like to...?

26:12.630 --> 26:14.960
Would you like to watch it with your friend?

26:22.210 --> 26:22.700
Thank you.

26:23.530 --> 26:24.620
But I have an appointment
for the weekend.

26:26.040 --> 26:26.510
All right.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.900
It's not that I couldn't say it.

26:37.010 --> 26:37.840
I did it on purpose.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.170
Of the many boys

26:40.190 --> 26:41.440
who have confessed to senior Xixi before,

26:41.890 --> 26:42.730
which one has succeeded?

26:43.370 --> 26:44.050
I did so

26:44.090 --> 26:45.650
to preserve a sliver of possibility.

26:46.170 --> 26:46.700
In this way,

26:46.700 --> 26:47.850
the chance of success will be greater.

26:50.390 --> 26:50.910
I mean it.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.740
Those boys who confessed to her before

26:52.760 --> 26:54.110
were all blacklisted.

26:54.430 --> 26:56.140
To confess directly is to court death.

26:58.220 --> 26:58.900
Stop chatting.

26:59.510 --> 27:00.190
The class will begin.

27:00.780 --> 27:01.420
Time to study.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.340
Let’s see today’s key points.

27:06.070 --> 27:07.760
Write these down in the notebook.

27:23.220 --> 27:23.730
Prof. Du.

27:26.040 --> 27:26.950
You scared me.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.080
Why looking at me?

27:30.640 --> 27:31.380
What are you looking at?

27:35.700 --> 27:36.710
I'm watching Su Chengcheng.

27:38.900 --> 27:39.790
Doesn't she

27:40.040 --> 27:41.170
realize it?

27:41.740 --> 27:43.090
She’s making a lot of noise

27:43.090 --> 27:44.290
in the lab,

27:44.610 --> 27:45.680
which greatly affected

27:46.450 --> 27:48.040
other students.

27:49.060 --> 27:49.960
I think it’s fine.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.150
Nonsense!

27:53.580 --> 27:54.940
Obviously she has nothing to do.

27:56.730 --> 27:57.130
Well.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.060
Ask her to go to the Equipment Center

28:00.040 --> 28:01.300
and bring over

28:01.300 --> 28:01.730
the newly arrived mouse padding.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.430
The mouse padding is quite heavy.

28:04.530 --> 28:05.320
She can’t make it alone.

28:05.860 --> 28:06.300
Well.

28:06.460 --> 28:07.150
I’ll go with her.

28:07.730 --> 28:08.310
What do you mean?

28:09.070 --> 28:10.510
Don’t you have any code

28:10.680 --> 28:11.960
or thesis to write?

28:13.010 --> 28:14.050
Do you also have nothing to do?

28:14.080 --> 28:14.520
It’s okay.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.820
Let me know if you have nothing to do.

28:15.950 --> 28:16.430
I have many things

28:16.460 --> 28:17.020
to arrange for you.

28:17.020 --> 28:18.150
Why is there one copy less?

28:18.730 --> 28:19.450
So weird.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.500
I missed one copy.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.700
[Receipt and Loan System of Experimental Teaching Instruments]

28:31.190 --> 28:33.230
Take a good look.

28:33.370 --> 28:34.580
The school stipulates that

28:35.110 --> 28:36.470
to borrows these experimental instruments,

28:36.510 --> 28:37.680
the units of the school

28:37.850 --> 28:38.970
have to fill in

28:39.000 --> 28:40.450
the instrument loan application form.

28:40.700 --> 28:41.290
And the form

28:41.290 --> 28:42.720
should be with the signature

28:43.010 --> 28:44.660
and seal of the person in charge of the unit.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.540
Professor, please make an exception

28:46.630 --> 28:47.640
in my favour.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.220
I will definitely send it to you.

28:49.220 --> 28:49.620
I promise to

28:49.620 --> 28:50.870
send the sealed form today.

28:50.890 --> 28:51.340
I’m begging you.

28:51.340 --> 28:52.450
It's no use begging me.

28:52.740 --> 28:53.950
Without a seal,

28:53.980 --> 28:54.700
how can I know

28:54.700 --> 28:55.620
if you are impersonating?

28:55.850 --> 28:56.220
Right?

28:56.570 --> 28:58.090
If anything happened,

28:58.200 --> 28:59.620
who would take the responsibility?

29:00.090 --> 29:00.530
Come in.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.770
I'm really not impersonating, professor.

29:03.330 --> 29:03.930
-Xiao.
-Prof. Tao.

29:04.470 --> 29:05.840
I’d like to borrow a spectrum analyzer.

29:06.100 --> 29:06.930
Spectrum analyzer?

29:06.970 --> 29:08.140
Okay, wait a minute.

29:09.420 --> 29:09.930
Thank you.

29:18.140 --> 29:19.090
-You are welcome.
-Let me.

29:20.540 --> 29:20.810
Okay.

29:21.470 --> 29:21.990
Thank you, Prof. Tao.

29:22.020 --> 29:22.700
You are welcome.

29:22.840 --> 29:23.380
Professor.

29:23.960 --> 29:24.640
He has

29:25.690 --> 29:27.050
no application form,

29:27.080 --> 29:28.170
let alone signature

29:28.170 --> 29:28.860
and seal.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.180
Why did you give it to him so casually?

29:30.210 --> 29:31.260
Xiao has been in our school

29:31.260 --> 29:32.130
for many years.

29:32.370 --> 29:33.820
He has borrowed instruments

29:33.860 --> 29:34.780
so many times.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.670
Everyone knows him.

29:37.900 --> 29:38.500
By the way, Xiao.

29:38.780 --> 29:39.580
Her procedures

29:39.580 --> 29:40.500
are not complete.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.060
But

29:41.060 --> 29:42.300
she said you are from the same lab.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.300
Do you know her?

29:44.100 --> 29:44.550
Yes.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.600
-We are from the same lab.
-Not quite familiar.

29:49.460 --> 29:51.060
No wonder I have never seen her.

29:51.810 --> 29:53.500
I will go get the padding for you.

29:53.850 --> 29:54.330
Hold on.

29:54.510 --> 29:55.200
Thank you, professor.

29:56.290 --> 29:56.820
Thank you.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.010
Padding weighs a lot.

30:00.180 --> 30:01.130
You are also going back to the lab.

30:01.130 --> 30:01.910
Do me a favor.

30:02.350 --> 30:03.370
Then delete the video.

30:04.730 --> 30:05.210
No.

30:05.260 --> 30:05.610
Bye.

30:25.570 --> 30:26.090
There are more.

30:30.450 --> 30:31.010
Seriously?

30:31.040 --> 30:32.200
The last two packs.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.460
All your padding.

30:47.730 --> 30:48.240
It must be heavy.

30:50.250 --> 30:50.840
How about this?

30:51.240 --> 30:51.980
Delete the video.

30:53.130 --> 30:54.130
I'll take care of the rest for you.

30:55.540 --> 30:57.020
Why should I

30:57.050 --> 30:57.820
delete the precious video?

30:57.920 --> 30:58.550
I don’t need you.

31:05.150 --> 31:06.410
How about I give you one-on-one tutoring

31:06.880 --> 31:08.110
to ensure your smooth graduation?

31:08.770 --> 31:09.540
One on one?

31:10.380 --> 31:11.620
If I study with you,

31:11.620 --> 31:12.250
I might as well not graduate.

31:29.870 --> 31:30.640
Sir.

31:32.580 --> 31:33.180
Sir.

31:34.580 --> 31:35.580
Your tricycle...

31:55.760 --> 31:56.250
Beauty.

32:23.660 --> 32:24.170
Senior.

32:24.580 --> 32:26.250
Thank you for revising the paper

32:26.280 --> 32:27.140
for me yesterday.

32:29.370 --> 32:30.450
Never mind.

32:35.210 --> 32:35.760
Senior.

32:36.170 --> 32:38.160
Anything I can do for you?

32:38.580 --> 32:39.420
How about I

32:39.440 --> 32:40.720
check the electrode caps for you?

32:42.260 --> 32:42.970
We’ll have

32:43.260 --> 32:45.050
a lab class today.

32:48.740 --> 32:49.250
Su Chengcheng has finished

32:49.290 --> 32:50.580
checking the electrode cap.

33:02.810 --> 33:03.670
Senior Dongmao.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.170
I really envy junior Chengcheng.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.090
She has only been here for a few days

33:08.120 --> 33:09.780
and she has integrated into the group.

33:09.890 --> 33:10.450
I heard that

33:10.710 --> 33:11.990
she insisted on entering our lab

33:12.320 --> 33:13.450
because she wanted to fall in love.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.140
She confessed her love to senior Xiao

33:15.160 --> 33:16.270
after meeting him

33:16.620 --> 33:17.730
only a few times.

33:18.780 --> 33:20.020
Girls nowadays

33:20.440 --> 33:21.190
are more and more

33:21.220 --> 33:22.180
open minded.

33:22.180 --> 33:22.650
I asked Su Chengcheng

33:22.650 --> 33:24.330
to come to the lab.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.990
It's not that she wanted to come herself.

33:36.620 --> 33:37.600
Don’t look at me like this!

33:57.360 --> 33:57.860
Chengcheng.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.400
Did you go get the mouse padding?

34:02.160 --> 34:02.540
Come on.

34:02.870 --> 34:03.480
I'll help you carry them upstairs.

34:03.740 --> 34:04.420
Great.

34:04.420 --> 34:05.600
I was struggling how to move them upstairs.

34:05.840 --> 34:06.860
Take the big one.

34:06.860 --> 34:07.580
I'll take care of the two little ones.

34:07.740 --> 34:08.000
Okay.

34:17.449 --> 34:18.730
Gu Chen, thank you today

34:18.730 --> 34:19.810
for doing me a great favor.

34:19.980 --> 34:20.830
I'll treat you to milk tea another day.

34:21.179 --> 34:22.090
Okay, deal.

34:23.060 --> 34:23.900
I’m going back.

34:23.900 --> 34:24.699
Sure, take care.

34:24.949 --> 34:25.340
Bye.

34:25.400 --> 34:25.880
Bye.

34:48.989 --> 34:50.420
Senior Jiafa is so handsome.

34:51.750 --> 34:52.590
Three wheels

34:52.630 --> 34:54.060
are smoother than two.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.290
Where did you borrow it from?

34:55.290 --> 34:55.980
I borrowed it

34:55.980 --> 34:57.060
from the scrap collector.

34:57.060 --> 34:57.810
Just charge it up

34:57.840 --> 34:58.810
when we're done.

34:59.380 --> 34:59.930
Junior Chengcheng.

34:59.930 --> 35:00.770
I really admire

35:00.770 --> 35:02.340
your core skill to survive

35:02.340 --> 35:03.690
from a desperate situation every time.

35:03.690 --> 35:04.550
Not at all.

35:04.860 --> 35:05.220
Senior.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.060
You look so good here.

35:06.060 --> 35:06.500
I’ll take a picture of you.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.120
Come on.

35:07.290 --> 35:08.050
Senior Jiafa.

35:08.850 --> 35:10.160
Give others a chance.

35:10.450 --> 35:11.020
Let me try.

35:11.180 --> 35:11.780
Come on.

35:11.780 --> 35:12.700
I’d also like to try.

35:13.110 --> 35:13.930
You first.

35:14.100 --> 35:14.670
Let me.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.370
Come on.

35:16.610 --> 35:17.480
I’ll take a picture for you.

35:17.920 --> 35:18.620
I’m also coming.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.340
I will try.

35:20.330 --> 35:21.420
Take a group photo.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.730
Come on.

35:23.500 --> 35:24.590
Senior, would you like to come over

35:24.620 --> 35:25.390
and take a photo together?

35:25.420 --> 35:26.260
Come on, get on.

35:27.380 --> 35:28.580
Okay, come here.

35:32.020 --> 35:33.140
Su Chengcheng.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.410
Not only do you not work yourself,

35:35.650 --> 35:36.540
but you also affect others.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.780
No wonder senior Xiao is so tired of you.

35:40.490 --> 35:41.730
The stuff for the monkey terrarium

35:41.730 --> 35:42.440
has arrived.

35:42.730 --> 35:44.330
Pick it up on the tricycle.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.070
Okay, I see.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.180
Anything else?

35:49.440 --> 35:49.860
No.

35:52.300 --> 35:52.870
Senior.

35:54.120 --> 35:54.660
What?

35:55.250 --> 35:56.230
I have something to tell you.

35:56.890 --> 35:57.540
You...

35:57.540 --> 35:59.200
Stay away from me.

36:01.190 --> 36:02.030
No, you...

36:02.050 --> 36:02.760
What are you doing?

36:08.190 --> 36:11.020
You got chocolate on your teeth

36:11.020 --> 36:11.720
and it's dark now.

36:20.110 --> 36:20.580
I didn’t mean it.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.330
It was she who asked me to stand away.

36:23.830 --> 36:24.280
Chengcheng.

36:24.540 --> 36:24.960
Chengcheng.

36:25.370 --> 36:26.200
Take another photo for us.

36:27.230 --> 36:27.640
Ready.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.270
One, two, three.

36:39.370 --> 36:40.850
Are you going to return the equipment?

36:41.580 --> 36:42.580
It’s so heavy.

36:42.860 --> 36:44.220
How about I let Su Chengcheng

36:44.220 --> 36:45.060
go with you?

36:46.140 --> 36:47.260
I look so ugly.

36:47.260 --> 36:47.680
Look for it.

36:49.740 --> 36:50.180
Look for it.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.340
Look for the photo I took just now.

36:51.370 --> 36:52.510
Much better looking than yourself.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.450
No way! Look.

36:54.730 --> 36:55.500
Look at the legs.

36:56.770 --> 36:57.380
No need.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.230
So powerful.

37:26.110 --> 37:27.030
I am so pissed off.

37:30.220 --> 37:31.210
Hello, Musk.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.910
Hello, Xiao Yuhe.

37:34.550 --> 37:35.820
Scan starts.

37:42.270 --> 37:44.250
[Eat instant noodles]

37:48.010 --> 37:49.160
Scan is over.

37:51.640 --> 37:52.060
Musk.

37:53.490 --> 37:54.620
Why can Su Chengcheng

37:54.620 --> 37:55.810
gather a large group of people

37:55.810 --> 37:56.930
no matter what she does?

37:57.600 --> 37:58.550
She has been like this since she was a child.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.700
But she's so cute

38:05.240 --> 38:05.850
like this.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.060
Chengcheng, good for you.

38:16.230 --> 38:17.380
Our lab has been discussing you

38:17.410 --> 38:18.110
all the morning.

38:18.180 --> 38:19.330
The photos of you riding a tricycle

38:19.330 --> 38:20.820
went viral all over the school.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.100
Li Meizi.

38:22.460 --> 38:23.090
They

38:23.090 --> 38:24.490
only saw my outward beauty,

38:24.520 --> 38:26.010
but they didn't see the tears behind.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.200
Let’s go.

38:28.740 --> 38:29.190
Let’s go.

38:32.420 --> 38:33.050
Come on.

38:35.810 --> 38:36.500
So dark.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.190
Why are the street lights

38:40.220 --> 38:41.070
all off today?

38:41.940 --> 38:42.540
They must be broken.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.320
Slow down. Watch your steps.

39:02.000 --> 39:02.680
Isn’t this...?

39:13.660 --> 39:14.370
He seemed to be deliberately

39:14.370 --> 39:15.170
lighting the way for us.

39:16.590 --> 39:17.420
How could he

39:17.420 --> 39:18.350
light the way for me?

39:18.660 --> 39:19.980
He wished

39:19.980 --> 39:21.290
I would stumble in the dark.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.000
Look, we gave way

39:23.040 --> 39:23.980
but he didn't leave.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.180
Are you two made peace?

39:25.470 --> 39:27.130
How come?

39:29.370 --> 39:30.480
Don’t look back.

39:50.020 --> 39:50.840
Stop looking back.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.200
No worries.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.540
Why are you walking so fast.

40:17.920 --> 40:18.700
Look.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.270
He is lighting the way for us.
