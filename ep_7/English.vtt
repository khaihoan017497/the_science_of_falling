01:56.479 --> 01:57.160
What a busy day.

02:01.590 --> 02:02.840
Everyone,

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
listen to me.

02:04.010 --> 02:05.310
I have something to tell you.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.450
As you know,

02:06.770 --> 02:07.650
our lab has been cooperating

02:07.680 --> 02:09.160
with the First Affiliated Hospital

02:09.160 --> 02:10.039
of Southeast Science

02:10.160 --> 02:11.039
and Technology University

02:11.039 --> 02:11.690
in clinical applications.

02:11.920 --> 02:12.560
Tomorrow

02:12.800 --> 02:13.890
we will conduct a double check

02:13.910 --> 02:15.390
on a patient.

02:15.630 --> 02:16.510
I personally think that

02:17.110 --> 02:18.070
for many members

02:18.100 --> 02:19.010
in our lab,

02:19.520 --> 02:20.920
this is a very good opportunity

02:20.920 --> 02:22.460
to learn and understand.

02:22.890 --> 02:23.430
So in principle,

02:24.079 --> 02:25.990
it is best not to ask for leave.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.250
The genetic engineering laboratory next door

02:29.250 --> 02:30.360
will also visit with us

02:30.360 --> 02:30.760
this time.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.540

02:33.320 --> 02:34.560

02:36.370 --> 02:38.680
Let’s gather at the East Gate of the school

02:39.040 --> 02:40.780
on time at 8:30 tomorrow morning,

02:40.950 --> 02:41.370
shall we?

02:41.870 --> 02:42.180
-No problem.
- No problem.

The recovery of the patient

03:05.080 --> 03:05.880
goes well,

03:06.080 --> 03:07.520
and there is basically no rejection.

03:07.850 --> 03:08.460
That’s good.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.680
That’s good.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.810
Today we are here

03:11.840 --> 03:12.970
mainly to review

03:13.000 --> 03:13.820
the patient's recovery.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.270
In addition, several media

03:16.440 --> 03:17.660
have been inviting interviews.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.780
Ms. Chen, to be honest,

03:21.190 --> 03:22.210
I am a little nervous today,

03:22.880 --> 03:23.960
because all the exoskeletons

03:23.990 --> 03:24.630
of the patient

03:24.650 --> 03:25.820
have to be controlled

03:25.850 --> 03:26.530
by his own brain nerves.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.710
Hope everything goes well.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.600
Take it easy.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.730
-Please.
- Please.

03:35.550 --> 03:35.870
Please.

03:45.870 --> 03:47.200
Today's focus is on items two and four.

03:59.400 --> 03:59.720
Okay.

04:04.090 --> 04:05.490
Step one, motor imagery.

04:06.440 --> 04:06.770
Grandpa.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.480
Visualize in your mind

04:08.610 --> 04:09.650
which leg to take first

04:10.120 --> 04:10.760
and how to get to

04:10.760 --> 04:11.800
the edge of the table.

04:39.880 --> 04:40.490
Very good.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.610
Step two, grab action.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.040
Grandpa.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.080
Try to grab this soy milk cup.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.580
Take it easy, grandpa.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.350
Just like our usual training.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.100
Lift it up.

04:59.510 --> 04:59.870
Right.

05:02.390 --> 05:03.600
No worries.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.750
Take it easy. Slow down.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.790
No worries. Slow down.

05:44.700 --> 05:45.540
Great.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.150
Record it.

06:03.660 --> 06:04.900
I’ve had it, grandpa.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.710
Record additional actions.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.370
I have something to say.

06:22.790 --> 06:23.760
All of you can see that

06:24.400 --> 06:25.830
today's result

06:26.280 --> 06:27.070
is a success

06:27.300 --> 06:28.540
and everyone is happy about it.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.250
But

06:30.450 --> 06:31.610
I don't want to talk about that.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.300
Instead, what I want to say

06:33.330 --> 06:34.510
is the hardships in the process.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.500
This patient

06:36.710 --> 06:37.750
had completely

06:38.250 --> 06:39.460
lost his motor skills

06:39.490 --> 06:40.380
due to a stroke last year.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.040
It put a lot of pressure

06:42.040 --> 06:43.400
on him psychologically.

06:43.940 --> 06:44.540
Not to mention

06:44.790 --> 06:46.470
cooperating with the experiment,

06:46.840 --> 06:47.800
he even rejected

06:47.800 --> 06:49.080
the most basic communication

06:49.150 --> 06:50.440
with others.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.580
But as you can see today,

06:53.390 --> 06:54.120
his mood

06:54.120 --> 06:55.190
has changed dramatically

06:55.650 --> 06:56.240
since being fitted

06:56.240 --> 06:57.620
with our exoskeleton.

06:58.280 --> 06:58.880
He also had

06:58.960 --> 07:00.370
a humorous interaction

07:00.390 --> 07:01.950
with Xiao Yuhe today.

07:01.970 --> 07:02.420
Right?

07:03.650 --> 07:05.120
That’s all.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.400
Let’s invite Xiao Yuhe,

07:06.520 --> 07:07.410
the technical backbone,

07:07.520 --> 07:08.480
to introduce you

07:08.480 --> 07:09.190
the technical details.

07:09.340 --> 07:09.650
Okay?

07:10.370 --> 07:11.210
In fact,

07:11.210 --> 07:11.990
as you can see,

07:12.470 --> 07:13.930
although grandpa hasn’t fully recovered,

07:14.400 --> 07:15.960
he can control the exoskeleton

07:15.960 --> 07:17.010
to do some simple body movements

07:17.030 --> 07:18.630
through nerve signals.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.480
Drinking soy milk and eating fried dough sticks

07:20.480 --> 07:21.200
is no problem for him.

07:23.290 --> 07:24.770
For paralyzed patients,

07:24.800 --> 07:25.520
this is something

07:25.520 --> 07:26.990
that is unimaginable.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.820
Senior Xiao is so great.

07:33.340 --> 07:34.300
Alright.

07:36.010 --> 07:36.530
Your turn.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.360
The biggest technical difficulty

07:38.360 --> 07:39.659
we encountered in this project

07:39.760 --> 07:41.400
was to correlate neuronal activity patterns

07:41.420 --> 07:42.760
with motor intentions

07:42.760 --> 07:44.280
to form specific trigger signals.

07:44.310 --> 07:45.070
The process of

07:45.090 --> 07:46.310
controlling the required exoskeleton

07:46.340 --> 07:47.890
according to the signal requires the patient

07:47.909 --> 07:49.470
to carry out certain training in the early stage.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.030
Yes, because of this,

07:51.060 --> 07:52.180
we continued to optimize it,

07:52.300 --> 07:53.180
and finally developed

07:53.220 --> 07:54.800
a brain-like artificial intelligence decoder.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.540
Through virtual reality training,

07:56.840 --> 07:58.080
it has achieved

07:58.120 --> 07:59.159
more accurate manipulation.

07:59.390 --> 08:00.460
That's why grandpa

08:00.480 --> 08:02.010
can operate so freely today.

08:02.220 --> 08:02.570
Right.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.150
At present, the number of paralyzed people

08:05.190 --> 08:06.370
caused by stroke,

08:06.400 --> 08:07.810
brain and spinal cord injury in the world

08:07.840 --> 08:09.880
has reached nearly 100 million people.

08:09.880 --> 08:10.490
There are 20 to 30 million

08:10.520 --> 08:11.360
in our country,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.520
and the data is still rising.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.330
In the future,

08:14.360 --> 08:15.730
our system and equipment

08:15.760 --> 08:16.400
will be further

08:16.400 --> 08:18.070
iterated and updated

08:18.120 --> 08:19.210

08:20.440 --> 08:21.370

08:21.390 --> 08:23.190
rebuild their behavioral

08:23.280 --> 08:24.400
and language functions,

08:24.560 --> 08:26.040
and improve their quality of life.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.120
As an extension of human senses,

08:28.460 --> 08:29.170
the value of science

08:29.560 --> 08:30.720
is to give those who need it

08:30.740 --> 08:31.460
a promise that

08:31.590 --> 08:32.730
they can

08:32.960 --> 08:33.890
live a better life.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.559
I didn't expect our major

08:43.559 --> 08:44.159
to be so amazing.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.530
Of course.

08:46.070 --> 08:47.350
Although our major is difficult,

08:47.460 --> 08:48.870
it is of great use.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.480
That’s why Xiao

08:50.480 --> 08:51.650
is usually so strict with us.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.440
Next time I will take you

08:54.440 --> 08:55.960

08:56.760 --> 08:57.600

14:28.210 --> 14:28.660
Yes.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.490
It's just that

14:32.510 --> 14:33.740
he transferred to another school suddenly,

14:35.000 --> 14:36.550
and then we lost contact.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.130
Did you get in touch later?

14:42.320 --> 14:42.880
Later...

14:45.450 --> 14:45.900
Later...

14:50.320 --> 14:51.070
I’ll answer the call.

14:52.950 --> 14:53.430
Hello.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.330
Chengcheng,

14:54.360 --> 14:55.400
I have arrived at the gate of your school.

14:55.530 --> 14:56.520
So soon?

14:56.890 --> 14:57.970
OK, I'll come and pick you up right away.

15:00.400 --> 15:00.960
Senior,

15:01.120 --> 15:02.400
my father came to see me at school.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.490
I have to pick him up.

15:03.910 --> 15:05.060
Let’s talk about it later.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.680
Musk, look.

15:33.000 --> 15:33.530
Musk.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.370
This is for you.

15:37.380 --> 15:38.220
Thank you.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.010
Do you think

15:45.200 --> 15:47.040
she also wanted to find me?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.600
Why don't you tell her

15:51.890 --> 15:53.140
you are Zhu Panpan?

15:56.070 --> 15:57.130
Because I'm afraid.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.030
Afraid of what?

16:06.390 --> 16:10.320
[Southeast Science and Technology University]

16:15.000 --> 16:15.500
Dad.

16:16.480 --> 16:16.990
Chengcheng.

16:17.430 --> 16:18.000
You’ve grown up.

16:18.000 --> 16:18.690
But you are still so reckless.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.760
Didn't you say to come on 3rd?

16:20.780 --> 16:21.420
Why didn't you tell me

16:21.460 --> 16:22.390
that you came in advance?

16:23.080 --> 16:23.560
Have you had lunch?

16:23.920 --> 16:24.480
Su.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.350
Aunt.

16:28.370 --> 16:28.880
Sister.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.840
Taking advantage of the holiday,

16:31.560 --> 16:33.130
I bring your brother over to see you,

16:33.900 --> 16:35.190
and by the way encourage him

16:35.360 --> 16:35.750
to get into a good school

16:35.780 --> 16:37.170
in the future.

16:38.080 --> 16:38.480
Well...

16:39.190 --> 16:39.890
Look at me.

16:40.080 --> 16:40.670
Hold on.

16:40.690 --> 16:41.550
I’ll go get another one.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.910
Don’t bother, aunt.

16:43.780 --> 16:44.870
I usually don't drink milk tea

16:44.900 --> 16:45.650
and the like.

16:47.190 --> 16:48.230
Let's go, I'll show you around.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.340
Follow your sister.

16:52.880 --> 16:53.250
Dad.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.370
Dad, this is the main entrance of my school.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.560
Everyone takes a group photo here.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.020
Those pictures you see on the Internet

16:58.040 --> 16:59.440
are here.

17:00.040 --> 17:00.450
Nice.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.280
Let's take a family photo.

17:02.480 --> 17:02.740
Here.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.359
Chengcheng, take it for us.

17:07.450 --> 17:08.020
Okay?

17:08.910 --> 17:09.300
Come on.

17:10.920 --> 17:11.380
Ready.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.359
Three, two, one.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.060
Aunt, closer.

17:17.180 --> 17:17.900
Get closer.

17:18.410 --> 17:18.750
-Like this.
-Okay.

17:21.069 --> 17:23.950
Three, two, one. Done.

17:24.109 --> 17:24.550
Done?

17:25.000 --> 17:25.720
Let me take a look.

17:28.390 --> 17:29.700
Chengcheng did a good job.

Nice one.

17:34.270 --> 17:34.800
Xuanang.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.200
Learn from your sister,

17:36.230 --> 17:36.690
understand?

17:36.720 --> 17:37.450
She’s so great to

17:37.480 --> 17:38.940
be admitted to such a nice school.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.700
It’s pretty nice.

17:43.690 --> 17:44.950
Let’s take a few pictures inside.

17:45.170 --> 17:45.470
Okay.

17:45.550 --> 17:46.580
There are also nice places.

17:46.610 --> 17:47.010
Right?

17:47.720 --> 17:48.200
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

Go.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.300
Let’s go.

He can wear these shoes

17:56.960 --> 17:57.520
during sports

17:57.520 --> 17:58.440
or leisure.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.080
Quite versatile.

17:59.080 --> 17:59.860
So nice.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.010
It’s really nice.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.220
Good.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.160
Stand up and walk around

18:04.180 --> 18:04.860
to see if it’s comfortable.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.530
It's really pretty,

18:08.560 --> 18:09.570
and it matches your outfit very well.

18:11.000 --> 18:11.660
Hello.

18:11.840 --> 18:12.900
We want both pairs of shoes

18:12.930 --> 18:13.570
we tried on.

18:14.530 --> 18:15.970
Aunt, I have enough shoes.

18:16.030 --> 18:16.720
You don’t need to buy for me.

18:21.120 --> 18:21.640
Chengcheng.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.010
Your dad

18:25.360 --> 18:26.080
likes to keep everything

18:26.080 --> 18:27.300
in his heart.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.660
Although he doesn't often contact you,

18:30.360 --> 18:31.000
he always

18:31.000 --> 18:32.310
misses you

18:33.390 --> 18:34.440
and often talks about you.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.620
Try to understand him,

18:38.520 --> 18:39.480
and don't blame him.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.620
Aunt, I see.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.440
I will keep in touch with my dad more often.

19:00.270 --> 19:00.890
Good girl.

19:03.500 --> 19:03.990
Nice.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.840
And this.

19:14.080 --> 19:14.890
Beef with cilantro.

19:15.450 --> 19:15.900
Okay.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.150
- That’s it. - Okay.

19:20.360 --> 19:20.810
Are you done picking?

19:21.160 --> 19:21.680
Have you ordered food?

19:21.760 --> 19:22.290
Yes.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.000
All your favorite.

This is Zhu Jiafa,

Hello, uncle.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.830
-Hello.
-These are my families.

19:35.240 --> 19:35.750
Hello, aunt.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.010
- Hello.
- Aunt looks so young.

19:37.240 --> 19:37.790
If you didn't tell me,

19:37.810 --> 19:39.090
I'd think she’s your sister.

19:41.830 --> 19:42.450
What a coincidence.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.540
Dad, these are the seniors

19:46.570 --> 19:47.650
of my laboratory.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.130
This is Xiao Yuhe.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.480
This is Liu Dongmao.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.260
Hello, uncle.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.670
The demands on our laboratory are high.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.440
I certainly wouldn't be able to stay

19:54.440 --> 19:55.080
without them

19:55.100 --> 19:55.990
taking care of me.

19:56.210 --> 19:57.320
Not at all.

19:57.690 --> 19:58.560
Let me invite you to lunch.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.520
No need, uncle.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.350
That table is almost cleared.

20:00.410 --> 20:00.920
Maybe next time.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.620
Bye, uncle.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.330
Bye, uncle.

20:02.980 --> 20:03.660
Here.

20:04.050 --> 20:05.090
Chengcheng's favorite dish,

20:05.110 --> 20:06.890
beef with cilantro.

20:15.580 --> 20:16.030
Chengcheng.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.820
I remember you don't eat cilantro.

20:20.400 --> 20:20.950
Right.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.210
It is your younger brother
who likes cilantro best.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.150
Look at me.

20:29.940 --> 20:30.870
Come on.

20:31.150 --> 20:32.360
Here, chopsticks.

20:35.390 --> 20:35.950
Chengcheng.

20:36.650 --> 20:37.440
Sorry.

20:37.590 --> 20:38.310
Nothing.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.510
Let’s eat.

20:43.220 --> 20:43.700
So delicious.

20:44.370 --> 20:45.650
The meat looks good.

20:48.370 --> 20:48.730
Here.

20:49.360 --> 20:49.880
Thank you.

20:51.200 --> 20:51.550
Dongmao.

20:52.340 --> 20:52.870
Your plate.

21:01.180 --> 21:01.750
[Xiao Junlan]

21:15.040 --> 21:15.920
Hello, more seasoning.

21:24.360 --> 21:24.920
Your seasoning, please.

21:24.920 --> 21:25.260
Thank you.

21:25.570 --> 21:26.160
You are welcome.

21:29.710 --> 21:30.910
In the past few years,

21:31.010 --> 21:32.270
Dr. Zhang from the School of Computer Science

21:32.300 --> 21:33.610
and the three of us came here together during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

21:33.990 --> 21:34.420
Look.

21:34.730 --> 21:36.120
Since he had a girlfriend,

21:36.120 --> 21:36.970
let alone the Mid-Autumn Festival,

21:37.010 --> 21:38.240
we haven't seen him in any festival.

21:39.120 --> 21:39.710
By the way, Yuhe.

21:40.750 --> 21:41.780
Aren’t you a local?

21:41.890 --> 21:42.970
Why do you seldom

21:43.110 --> 21:43.880
go home?

21:43.950 --> 21:44.760
It’s Mid-Autumn Festival today.

21:50.040 --> 21:50.610
My parents separated

21:50.630 --> 21:51.830
when I was a kid.

21:53.250 --> 21:54.370
I don't like festivals,

21:55.000 --> 21:55.720
so I don't often come back.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.250
I understand.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.970
But it’s after all the Mid-Autumn Festival,

22:04.280 --> 22:06.620
you have to be with your family,

22:06.640 --> 22:07.090
right?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.140
And you can talk everything

22:10.050 --> 22:11.390
with your family.

22:12.480 --> 22:12.880
Right.

22:13.490 --> 22:14.550
How about we have something to drink?

22:14.800 --> 22:15.200
Sure.

22:15.490 --> 22:16.820
To celebrate the festival.

22:17.120 --> 22:17.530
What do you want?

22:18.880 --> 22:19.770
Mineral water.

22:21.000 --> 22:21.900
The same to me.

22:23.190 --> 22:23.670
Waiter.

22:24.030 --> 22:25.160
Two mineral water

22:25.210 --> 22:26.680
and one iced Coke.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.130
A signature durian mango flavour.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.000
Okay.

22:41.070 --> 22:42.560
And a Mango Sago.

22:42.880 --> 22:43.230
Okay.

22:43.670 --> 22:44.140
What do you want?

22:46.080 --> 22:48.220
Your brother is cute, isn’t he?

22:50.030 --> 22:51.130
How are you at school?

22:52.830 --> 22:53.460
Good.

22:54.120 --> 22:54.730
Are you short of money?

22:55.040 --> 22:55.900
Not at all.

22:56.200 --> 22:56.720
By the way,

22:57.120 --> 22:58.680
are you graduating from college next year?

23:03.370 --> 23:05.050
I'm just a sophomore this year, dad.

23:07.090 --> 23:08.230
What's wrong with me today?

23:15.120 --> 23:17.170
Take it to buy something you like.

23:27.230 --> 23:28.640
Now no one gives cash.

23:29.030 --> 23:30.290
All transfers are made online.

23:33.990 --> 23:34.850
Your aunt

23:36.740 --> 23:38.580
will check my transfer records.

23:40.830 --> 23:41.950
I'm sorry for you.

23:56.960 --> 23:57.440
Grandpa Liu.

23:59.110 --> 23:59.840
Yuhe is back.

24:02.320 --> 24:02.750
Grandpa Huang.

24:02.770 --> 24:04.130
Yuhe, long time no see.

24:05.210 --> 24:05.770
Go ahead.

24:06.290 --> 24:06.890
Sure.

24:07.570 --> 24:08.320
Let’s continue.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.480
Look at you.

24:10.570 --> 24:11.100
Granny Guan.

24:11.130 --> 24:11.950
Yuhe is back.

24:12.170 --> 24:13.870
You are getting more and more handsome.

24:14.110 --> 24:15.150
You finally learned it,

24:15.360 --> 24:16.400
but why did you forget everything

24:16.420 --> 24:17.380
in the exam today?

24:18.970 --> 24:19.890
Yuhe is back.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.270
Aunt.

24:21.170 --> 24:21.840
Can't you

24:21.840 --> 24:23.320
learn more from Yuhe?

24:23.600 --> 24:24.860
When Yuhe was young,

24:25.200 --> 24:26.630
his mother never worried about him.

24:29.600 --> 24:29.910
It’s okay.

24:30.890 --> 24:32.240
Step by step.

25:19.230 --> 25:20.400
Mom, I’m back.

25:20.990 --> 25:21.580
You are back.

25:23.140 --> 25:24.120
The meal is almost ready.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.080
I am preparing a soup.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.760
I will go back to my room.

27:00.890 --> 27:03.060
I made chicken soup for you.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.180
I didn't put any salt in it.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.090
But I think

27:10.650 --> 27:12.240
it is a bit fishy without salt.

27:14.580 --> 27:15.570
Let me add some soup.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.210
I don't like chicken soup with salt.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.120
I know.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.570
But it’s fishy

27:21.320 --> 27:22.370
without salt.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.420
Add some.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.300
Try this.

28:22.930 --> 28:25.250
Mom, where is

28:25.290 --> 28:26.180
our family photo?

28:33.880 --> 28:34.810
I felt that

28:36.030 --> 28:37.010
some of the furnishings in our house

28:39.960 --> 28:40.580
were quite old,

28:41.600 --> 28:43.050
and they would be a nuisance,

28:43.360 --> 28:44.330
so I

28:44.620 --> 28:45.010
threw them all away.

28:48.820 --> 28:49.750
Indeed.

28:52.610 --> 28:53.570
But I don't feel like

28:54.610 --> 28:55.890
a photo is a nuisance.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.060
And

28:58.490 --> 28:59.990
you shouldn't deal with my items

29:00.280 --> 29:01.470
without my permission.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.080
Eat first.

29:17.450 --> 29:18.420
Let’s talk after the meal.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.100
I’ve had enough, mom.

29:45.430 --> 29:45.800
Tell me

29:47.260 --> 29:47.810
where did you throw it.

29:57.400 --> 29:58.270
What do you mean?

30:01.320 --> 30:02.680
Are you trying to get it back?

30:08.880 --> 30:10.110
You care so much about your dad,

30:13.730 --> 30:16.530
but he left you at home

30:16.720 --> 30:17.920
and went abroad by himself.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.990
Think about it.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.210
I have been busy

30:36.260 --> 30:37.210
working for you

30:37.240 --> 30:38.040
since you were a child,

30:38.120 --> 30:39.330
raising you up.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.650
Have you

30:41.650 --> 30:42.560
considered my feelings

30:43.130 --> 30:43.680
during the years

30:45.270 --> 30:45.620
when that photo

30:48.070 --> 30:49.480
was kept at home?

31:00.270 --> 31:01.350
I have something to do in the lab.

31:02.340 --> 31:03.040
I’m leaving.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.550
Mom, what you threw away

31:14.580 --> 31:16.060
was a photo of our family,

31:17.430 --> 31:18.710
not just that of my dad.

32:00.480 --> 32:00.980
Chengcheng.

32:02.040 --> 32:02.810
Don’t you need me to send you back?

32:03.360 --> 32:04.370
No need, dad.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.900
It is very convenient to take a taxi here,

32:05.920 --> 32:07.200
and it is not far from the school.

32:07.610 --> 32:08.240
You can get on the expressway

32:08.240 --> 32:08.880
directly from here.

32:08.900 --> 32:09.470
Very convenient.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.070
I see.

32:21.550 --> 32:22.580
Take it, Chengcheng.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.690
Let’s not be like this.

32:25.130 --> 32:26.890
I’m really not short of money.

32:27.710 --> 32:28.910
Look, aunt bought me

32:28.930 --> 32:30.040
a lot of things already.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.410
That's enough for me.

32:32.080 --> 32:32.730
You don't have to be so embarrassed

32:32.760 --> 32:33.440
because of me.

32:36.430 --> 32:37.080
Your brother is coming.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.080
Here you are.

32:44.750 --> 32:45.320
Chengcheng.

32:45.900 --> 32:47.220
You should have a few days left

32:47.250 --> 32:48.340
on your vacation.

32:48.450 --> 32:49.690
Don't you want to hang out with us?

32:49.880 --> 32:50.360
It's boring

32:50.390 --> 32:51.210
to be alone in school.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.900
I’m not going, aunt.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.290
I...

32:56.250 --> 32:57.130
Anything in school?

32:57.530 --> 32:58.260
I haven’t

32:58.400 --> 32:59.640
finished my homework.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.370
So I want to catch up

33:01.390 --> 33:02.420
during the holidays.

33:02.960 --> 33:03.920
Alright.

33:04.160 --> 33:04.980
That’s fine.

33:05.370 --> 33:06.960
Come home next time you have a holiday.

33:06.990 --> 33:08.030
I'll cook something delicious for you.

33:08.110 --> 33:08.530
Okay.

33:09.090 --> 33:09.920
Say goodbye to your sister.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.010
Bye.

33:11.810 --> 33:12.850
Get in the car.

33:14.130 --> 33:15.260
Keep in touch.

34:27.270 --> 34:27.949
Take a seat.

34:28.850 --> 34:30.639
The bus is dangling and dangerous.

34:31.409 --> 34:32.449
You will fall down.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.210
-No.
-Stand firm.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.260
Take a seat.

34:40.710 --> 34:41.420
So naughty.

34:43.239 --> 34:44.790
I want to eat McDonald's tonight.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.820
McDonald's again?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.570
You are so fat!

34:48.590 --> 34:50.210
Look at you.

34:50.989 --> 34:51.880
Am I?

34:52.020 --> 34:53.060
No?

34:53.090 --> 34:54.650
What a fatty.

34:56.090 --> 34:57.280
You…Listen.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.500
If you get ninety-five points in the English test,

34:59.450 --> 35:04.020
[Dad]

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I will take you to McDonald's.

35:03.030 --> 35:04.460
Okay, deal.

35:04.590 --> 35:06.240
Deal.

35:06.830 --> 35:07.660
Pinky promise.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.010
You know

35:11.010 --> 35:11.640
your mom well.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.030
I really worry about

35:14.120 --> 35:15.050
you living with her.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.200
I have already processed your documents

35:17.200 --> 35:18.190
for going abroad.

35:18.670 --> 35:19.390
Think about it.

35:20.090 --> 35:21.900
How about going abroad with me?

35:24.590 --> 35:25.870
I have decided to stay here.

35:29.950 --> 35:30.370
Alright.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.040
You have grown up.

35:32.410 --> 35:33.450
I understand

35:34.080 --> 35:34.660
you have your own ideas.

35:35.610 --> 35:36.880
If you encounter any difficulties in the future,

35:38.080 --> 35:39.050
let me know anytime,

35:39.300 --> 35:40.570
and I will make it back to see you.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.500
Dad, don't worry about that.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.340
I’ve made

35:45.360 --> 35:46.480
a good friend at school.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.160
Her name is Su Chengcheng.

35:49.610 --> 35:50.470
She is very nice to me.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.360
Whenever I meet difficulties,

35:52.360 --> 35:53.210
she will help me.

35:53.830 --> 35:54.460
Really?

35:55.030 --> 35:55.880
You kid!

35:56.520 --> 35:57.080
Are you finally willing

35:57.080 --> 35:57.930
to be friends with your classmates?

35:59.610 --> 36:01.130
But you have to study hard.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.240
I am leaving.

36:05.120 --> 36:05.710
I bought you

36:05.730 --> 36:06.610
a new mobile phone.

36:07.230 --> 36:08.030
Remember to call me.

36:08.780 --> 36:09.140
Okay.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.790
Chengcheng doesn't like cilantro.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.680
Dad will help you pick up

36:59.710 --> 37:00.840
all the cilantro,

37:01.050 --> 37:01.570
okay?

37:01.730 --> 37:02.120
Okay!

37:09.840 --> 37:11.480
Smile.

37:22.120 --> 37:22.790
What are you doing?

37:24.000 --> 37:24.480
Hold on.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.190
I'm going to see Chengcheng.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.250
It’s late. Don’t go in.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.130
Look at you.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.830
Why are you so drunk every day?

37:29.970 --> 37:30.740
Just take a look.

37:31.630 --> 37:32.900
What are you doing, Su Zhiqiang?

37:33.570 --> 37:34.020
Chengcheng.

37:34.790 --> 37:35.910
My good girl.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.130
She looks so much like me.

37:37.330 --> 37:38.930
My baby!

37:38.960 --> 37:39.530
Enough.

37:39.570 --> 37:40.580
Leave.

37:40.610 --> 37:41.280
Get out.

37:41.470 --> 37:43.150
Get out.

37:43.370 --> 37:43.800
No way.

37:44.050 --> 37:44.740
What else do you want?

37:45.310 --> 37:46.640
I’m giving a present to my daughter.

37:48.550 --> 37:49.070
Get out.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.220
Her favorite.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.580
Chengcheng, I love you.

37:52.720 --> 37:53.330
I love you.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.100
Chengcheng.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.450
Enough.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.010
Leave.

37:57.800 --> 37:58.360
Look at you.

37:59.090 --> 37:59.880
Get out.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.170
Chengcheng, I love you.
