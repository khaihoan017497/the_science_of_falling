Repeat.

00:19.020 --> 00:19.810
I like you.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.440
No, you don't like me at all.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.380
- I mean...
- Don't move.

00:26.190 --> 00:26.930
The device is expensive.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.280
I really like you.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.350
their ventral tegmental area

00:33.350 --> 00:34.430
and caudate nucleus will be activated.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.080
Near-infrared brain function image results

00:36.100 --> 00:36.640
show that,

00:36.670 --> 00:37.670
when you said you liked me,

00:37.670 --> 00:38.750
those parts of your brain were unresponsive.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.000
So you don't like me at all.

00:40.030 --> 00:40.980
My data

00:41.010 --> 00:42.280
didn't change

00:43.670 --> 00:44.910
because the bad environment

00:45.020 --> 00:46.340
affected my mood.

00:46.390 --> 00:46.920
My brain activities

00:46.950 --> 00:48.040
were naturally depressed.

00:48.350 --> 00:48.880
I know that

00:48.910 --> 00:50.060
I do like you.

00:50.080 --> 00:50.560
How can you prove that

00:50.590 --> 00:52.070
it's caused by external factors

00:52.090 --> 00:52.680
rather than

00:52.710 --> 00:53.880
you don't like me at all?

00:56.150 --> 00:56.590
When

00:56.970 --> 00:58.060
I see you,

00:58.090 --> 00:58.840
my heart beats faster.

00:58.870 --> 01:00.250
There are many reasons for the rapid heartbeat.

01:00.550 --> 01:01.070
Pressure,

01:01.430 --> 01:01.890
anxiety,

01:02.080 --> 01:02.870
lack of sleep,

01:02.940 --> 01:03.580
and stimulating beverage

01:03.610 --> 01:04.780
can all accelerate heartbeat.

01:05.269 --> 01:06.710
I blush when I see you.

01:06.710 --> 01:07.510
I dream of you

01:07.510 --> 01:07.910
at night.

01:07.910 --> 01:08.830
Blushed face may indicate

01:08.830 --> 01:09.500
cervical spondylosis.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.340
Cervical displacement stimulates sympathetic nerve,

01:11.370 --> 01:12.720
causing facial angiotelectasis.

01:13.050 --> 01:13.510
As for dreams,

01:13.830 --> 01:14.840
there are even more reasons.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.400
How do you want me to prove that

01:16.430 --> 01:17.080
I like you?

01:17.450 --> 01:18.830
Now that you've joined our lab

01:18.850 --> 01:19.289
and become

01:19.320 --> 01:20.280
a member of our research group,

01:20.310 --> 01:21.300
we should use scientific methods

01:21.300 --> 01:21.880
to prove it.

01:22.340 --> 01:22.980
Like, do experiments.

01:23.870 --> 01:24.580
Do experiments

03:27.040 --> 03:28.390
I thought with a 7:1 male to female ratio

I would have a romantic

He wore a helmet.

Later,

you can check with the counselor.

26:14.630 --> 26:15.450
Hello,

26:16.260 --> 26:17.240
I'm Su Chengcheng.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.420
I'm new here

26:19.440 --> 26:20.280
to gain

26:20.390 --> 26:21.470
my creative credit.

26:21.940 --> 26:22.560
Hello.

26:22.670 --> 26:23.590
What grade are you in?

26:23.760 --> 26:24.460
I'm a sophomore.

26:24.670 --> 26:25.190
Sophomore?

26:25.980 --> 26:26.540
An undergraduate?

26:27.240 --> 26:28.970
Have you got a GPA of 4.9?

26:30.330 --> 26:31.270
Not yet.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.850
Then you must have come to the wrong lab.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.120
I didn't.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.460
Xiao Yuhe asked me to come here.

26:36.070 --> 26:36.510
Yuhe?

26:37.790 --> 26:39.230
You don't have a high GPA,

26:39.230 --> 26:40.110
and you're an undergraduate.

26:40.210 --> 26:41.240
Why did he recruit you?

26:41.590 --> 26:42.750
He did ask me to come.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.410
He gave me this key card.

26:51.470 --> 26:52.630
What's your

26:53.290 --> 26:53.930
relationship with him?

26:54.510 --> 26:55.380
I have nothing to do with him.

27:01.510 --> 27:02.830
Because I said I liked him,

27:02.830 --> 27:03.550
so he asked me to fill in

27:03.550 --> 27:04.270
an application form

27:04.270 --> 27:05.010
and let me join the lab.

27:12.020 --> 27:14.090
Yuhe has never done this before.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.000
Is it because...

27:16.020 --> 27:16.580
Is it?

27:21.870 --> 27:23.070
Chengcheng,

27:23.070 --> 27:24.540
you're one of us now.

27:24.560 --> 27:24.960
Sure.

27:24.990 --> 27:25.830
How about

27:25.850 --> 27:27.520
we give you a tour

27:27.550 --> 27:28.300
around the lab?

27:29.220 --> 27:29.940
I'm going too.

27:30.160 --> 27:30.750
I'm going too.

27:30.970 --> 27:31.790
This is Zhang Li,

27:31.830 --> 27:32.710
from the Control Department.

27:32.710 --> 27:33.550
The robot dog is his.

27:33.550 --> 27:34.350
Get back to your work.

27:34.670 --> 27:35.070
Let's go.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.060
Have you printed all the logos?

27:36.280 --> 27:36.960
Go print them.

27:37.590 --> 27:38.910
Chengcheng, going forward from here

27:38.910 --> 27:41.230
is Prof. Du's office.

27:41.250 --> 27:41.830
Yes.

27:43.420 --> 27:44.420
I'm Liu Dongmao,

27:44.650 --> 27:45.850
from the Computer Department.

27:46.210 --> 27:47.570
This fat guy

27:47.600 --> 27:48.440
is Zhu Jiafa

27:48.470 --> 27:49.610
from the Control Department.

27:49.910 --> 27:50.890
We're responsible for

27:50.920 --> 27:52.370
the mechanical parts of the brain-computer interface.

27:52.990 --> 27:54.350
By the way, in our lab,

27:54.350 --> 27:55.190
there's a senior who is

27:55.190 --> 27:56.550
very good at brain surgery.

27:56.750 --> 27:57.770
She's responsible for

27:57.790 --> 27:59.110
the invasive brain-computer interface,

27:59.260 --> 28:00.990
which is to implant a chip in the brain

28:01.010 --> 28:02.220
to control an external device.

28:02.660 --> 28:03.920
As for Yuhe...

28:04.870 --> 28:06.430
I don't need to say much.

28:06.450 --> 28:07.830
You must know him well enough.

28:08.410 --> 28:09.480
He didn't tell me anything.

28:10.650 --> 28:11.210
Sounds fair.

28:11.830 --> 28:13.310
Yuhe doesn't like

28:13.310 --> 28:14.730
to talk about himself.

28:15.270 --> 28:15.990
But with more time,

28:15.990 --> 28:16.830
you'll gradually

28:16.830 --> 28:17.760
know him.

28:19.020 --> 28:19.620
No...

28:19.790 --> 28:21.020
Chengcheng, this way.

28:21.950 --> 28:22.270
Go.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.430
The Brain and Intelligence Lab

28:27.460 --> 28:28.760
is a national key lab

28:28.790 --> 28:29.990
of multidisciplinary

28:30.020 --> 28:31.340
brain-computer integration.

28:31.630 --> 28:32.790
Our three main

28:32.790 --> 28:33.950
research fields are

28:34.150 --> 28:35.540
invasive bain-computer interface,

28:35.590 --> 28:37.510
non-intrusive bain-computer interface,

28:37.550 --> 28:38.310
and AI brain-like computing.

28:39.230 --> 28:40.700
Top-level lab.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.130
Avatar in real life.

28:42.750 --> 28:43.150
Yes.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.350
Avatar used the

28:44.370 --> 28:45.450
brain-computer interface tech.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.190
It's cutting-edge

28:46.190 --> 28:47.270
technology,

28:47.430 --> 28:48.150
which can integrate

28:48.150 --> 28:49.430
humans and computers

28:49.530 --> 28:50.610
by reading EEG signals.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.670
For example, it helps people control

28:52.700 --> 28:54.570
robots and mechanical arms through mind.

28:54.790 --> 28:55.830
Meanwhile, it's helpful in solving

28:55.830 --> 28:57.070
many medical problems

28:57.070 --> 28:59.070
like enabling paralyzed patients

28:59.070 --> 29:01.460
to regain action competence.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.090
This is the brainwave control.

29:05.790 --> 29:06.540
Here, have a try.

29:06.940 --> 29:07.750
The more concentrated you are,

29:07.830 --> 29:08.790
the faster the car runs.

29:13.900 --> 29:14.830
Cool!

29:15.620 --> 29:16.110
Did you

29:16.110 --> 29:17.270
do this with Jiafa?

29:17.440 --> 29:18.050
Well,

29:18.310 --> 29:19.180
absolutely.

29:20.910 --> 29:22.110
But we did the

29:22.110 --> 29:23.180
mechanical part mostly.

29:23.380 --> 29:24.560
Yuhe did

29:25.200 --> 29:26.120
the algorithm.

29:27.000 --> 29:27.770
He did?

29:28.190 --> 29:29.990
Yes, he's basically

29:29.990 --> 29:30.740
responsible for algorithms

29:30.770 --> 29:32.000
concerning all our research projects.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.710
Aren't you recruited by him?

29:33.860 --> 29:34.940
Work hard and learn from him.

29:36.470 --> 29:36.810
So,

29:37.470 --> 29:38.880
will he come to the lab today?

29:39.190 --> 29:40.230
Sure. He comes every day.

29:40.230 --> 29:40.620
Yeah.

29:41.310 --> 29:41.720
Here he comes.

29:43.030 --> 29:44.180
Speak of the devil.

29:44.210 --> 29:44.890
Here the devil comes.

29:52.030 --> 29:52.350
It's OK.

29:52.410 --> 29:53.230
Thanks, Dongmao.

29:53.270 --> 29:53.800
Go ahead.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.880
Yuhe is dull usually.

29:59.910 --> 30:01.380
Who would think he has such a junior?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.350
I'm going to make her a coffee.

30:05.590 --> 30:06.070
Go ahead.

30:12.410 --> 30:13.020
Yuhe,

30:13.860 --> 30:15.210
I came to report for duty.

30:20.780 --> 30:22.390
They gave me

30:22.420 --> 30:23.570
a tour around the lab.

30:25.110 --> 30:25.820
I saw it.

30:26.010 --> 30:26.990
You had a good time.

30:30.830 --> 30:31.550
Anything else?

30:37.990 --> 30:39.060
I want to know

30:39.740 --> 30:41.860
why did you let me join the lab?

30:44.980 --> 30:45.540
And,

30:45.540 --> 30:49.480
what do you think of

30:49.950 --> 30:50.930
the thing I told you yesterday?

30:53.590 --> 30:54.990
During work, I only answer

30:54.990 --> 30:56.150
work-related questions.

30:56.510 --> 30:57.020
As for unrelated things,

30:57.530 --> 30:58.600
we can talk after 8:00 PM.

31:03.020 --> 31:03.800
8:00 PM, right?

31:04.620 --> 31:06.090
OK. I'll wait for you.

31:24.820 --> 31:25.660
What do you think?

31:26.740 --> 31:27.520
Think what?

31:27.900 --> 31:28.800
Chengcheng.

31:29.230 --> 31:30.150
It's rare for you

31:30.150 --> 31:31.630
to bring a girlfriend to the lab.

31:31.710 --> 31:32.270
Rest assured.

31:32.430 --> 31:33.460
I've arranged for you

31:33.460 --> 31:35.070
clearly and properly.

31:35.190 --> 31:36.330
No problem.

31:36.790 --> 31:37.910
Have you solved the problem

31:37.910 --> 31:38.570
of noise reduction clarity

31:39.470 --> 31:40.950
and improved the accuracy of the singular value

31:40.950 --> 31:41.510
based on wavelet analysis?

31:41.830 --> 31:43.710
Are you really so free?

31:43.790 --> 31:44.630
It only needs an undergraduate

31:44.630 --> 31:45.560
to distract you from work.

31:46.510 --> 31:47.410
Is there no problem?

31:48.380 --> 31:49.320
Shouldn't you arrange some work

31:49.340 --> 31:50.440
for the newcomer?

31:50.840 --> 31:51.970
Why are you staring at me?

31:52.240 --> 31:53.490
Do I look like wavelet analysis?

32:13.790 --> 32:14.860
Here. Have a try.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.070
This coffee is only served

32:17.070 --> 32:17.830
to those who officially

32:17.830 --> 32:19.150
join the Brain

32:19.230 --> 32:19.950
and Intelligence Lab.

32:26.050 --> 32:27.370
No food and drink in the lab.

32:27.910 --> 32:29.390
The cleaning lady

32:29.470 --> 32:30.990
asked for a day off today.

32:31.190 --> 32:32.430
Newcomer, you clean

32:32.430 --> 32:32.950
the lab later.

32:32.950 --> 32:33.470
Jiafa,

32:33.470 --> 32:34.610
tell her about the dos and don'ts.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.130
Tell her what?

32:40.530 --> 32:40.970
What?

32:42.130 --> 32:43.480
Xiao Yuhe recruited her...

32:44.590 --> 32:45.400
Come here quickly.

32:45.430 --> 32:45.870
Wait.

32:46.380 --> 32:47.270
Tell her what?

32:49.790 --> 32:51.150
It seems that Yuhe recruited her

32:51.150 --> 32:51.750
not because he

32:51.750 --> 32:52.720
felt that way about her.

32:52.790 --> 32:54.140
What way?

32:54.140 --> 32:55.070
That way.

32:57.150 --> 32:58.690
Let me tell you, really...

33:02.790 --> 33:03.140
So...

35:12.680 --> 35:14.160
Yuhe, you're here.

35:24.030 --> 35:24.720
So,

35:25.930 --> 35:26.880
what's your answer?

35:27.950 --> 35:28.760
Does it matter?

35:31.460 --> 35:32.010
It does.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.860
When the form is printed out,

35:39.170 --> 35:39.930
fill in your information.

35:41.820 --> 35:42.440
And then?

35:42.740 --> 35:44.220
Conduct brain data acquisition experiment.

35:46.270 --> 35:47.850
What's a brain data acquisition experiment?

35:48.170 --> 35:49.170
To extract brain data

35:49.210 --> 35:50.140
with professional devices.

35:50.420 --> 35:51.550
Didn't you say you liked me?

35:51.840 --> 35:53.270
You have to prove it in a scientific way.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.330
I know clearly that I like you.

35:57.510 --> 35:58.210
I don't need an experiment.

35:58.470 --> 35:59.900
The word "like" is too abstract

35:59.900 --> 36:00.630
and unreal.

36:00.830 --> 36:02.040
Only scientific data

36:02.160 --> 36:03.140
won't lie.

36:03.650 --> 36:05.070
I didn't lie to you. It's for real.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.770
Feelings are deceptive.

36:07.530 --> 36:08.850
Maybe you're cheated by yourself,

36:08.910 --> 36:09.750
only that you don't know.

36:17.430 --> 36:17.760
Fill it in.

36:25.620 --> 36:26.290
So many?

36:28.430 --> 36:28.980
How about this,

36:29.210 --> 36:29.880
I ask and you answer me.

36:34.870 --> 36:36.430
-Name.
-Su Chengcheng.

36:36.430 --> 36:37.270
-Native place.
-Jinjiang.

36:37.270 --> 36:38.470
Name of your elementary school.

36:38.470 --> 36:39.320
Jinjiang Experimental Primary School.

36:39.340 --> 36:40.380
Favorite snack in childhood.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.230
Popsicle. Long

36:42.230 --> 36:42.750
and could be broken.

36:42.750 --> 36:43.470
Favorite color.

36:43.870 --> 36:44.320
Chromatic colors.

36:44.350 --> 36:44.840
Be specific.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.280
Blue, red, yellow...

36:50.310 --> 36:51.020
You're passionate.

36:52.990 --> 36:53.730
Let's say tolerant.

36:57.860 --> 36:58.790
Do you like to make friends?

36:59.030 --> 36:59.460
Yes.

36:59.490 --> 37:00.330
Do you think it's difficult to make friends?

37:00.390 --> 37:01.030
Not at all.

37:01.210 --> 37:02.570
What's your definition of friends?

37:02.630 --> 37:04.170
Be frank with each other and do anything for each other.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.040
How long does friendship last?

37:06.200 --> 37:06.690
A lifetime.

37:07.030 --> 37:07.640
What about love?

37:08.930 --> 37:09.760
Also a lifetime.

37:10.350 --> 37:11.790
It turns out that love and friendship

37:11.790 --> 37:12.820
are the same in your eyes.

37:15.540 --> 37:16.460
You set me in a trap.

37:16.980 --> 37:17.630
Stop it.

37:19.540 --> 37:20.830
The more honest you are,

37:20.830 --> 37:22.190
the more accurate the data is.

37:22.360 --> 37:22.850
Is that clear?

37:24.580 --> 37:25.260
Let me proceed.

37:26.420 --> 37:27.550
Do you like your childhood?

37:34.000 --> 37:34.490
Why?

37:39.530 --> 37:40.840
I can date when I grow up.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.360
Didn't you have many friends?

37:47.060 --> 37:47.870
Do you still remember

37:47.890 --> 37:48.940
your best friends' names in childhood?

37:50.390 --> 37:51.160
Your best friends.

37:53.850 --> 37:54.590
Well, is there something wrong

37:54.610 --> 37:55.520
with your question?

37:56.760 --> 37:58.670
What do my best friends' names

37:58.670 --> 37:59.830
have to do with

37:59.830 --> 38:00.710
whether I like you or not?

38:00.710 --> 38:02.190
It's used to assess whether

38:02.220 --> 38:03.370
you are committed to a relationship.

38:04.280 --> 38:04.740
Go ahead.

38:05.060 --> 38:05.560
What are their names?

38:10.650 --> 38:11.320
Wang Lunye.

38:16.900 --> 38:17.440
Yuhang.

38:18.250 --> 38:18.710
Beibei.

38:18.750 --> 38:19.260
Mengmeng.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.410
And many others.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.120
Is that all?

38:29.440 --> 38:30.750
You don't know them, anyway.

38:32.020 --> 38:32.370
That's all.

38:52.980 --> 38:53.580
Su Chengcheng.

38:54.220 --> 38:55.350
Did you really forget me?
