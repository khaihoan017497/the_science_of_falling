15:43.510 --> 15:44.200
Well,

15:44.430 --> 15:45.110
have you seen

15:45.130 --> 15:46.090
the oranges on the desk?

15:46.260 --> 15:46.810
Oh, those.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.380
They were thrown away.

15:47.470 --> 15:48.390
Thrown away?

15:48.730 --> 15:49.330
What?

15:49.350 --> 15:50.310
They've gone bad.

15:50.390 --> 15:51.710
They were used to practice suturing

15:51.710 --> 15:52.710
by our senior,

15:52.730 --> 15:53.360
and now you threw them away.

15:53.730 --> 15:54.530
If she asks,

15:54.560 --> 15:55.390
do not mention me.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.590
I've never been here.

15:58.110 --> 15:58.660

15:58.940 --> 15:59.710

16:00.140 --> 16:00.930
Good luck.

16:07.590 --> 16:09.060
Is she so terrifying?

16:10.990 --> 16:12.150
I'm screwed.

16:35.420 --> 16:36.250
These two

16:37.150 --> 16:38.030
should do.

16:41.220 --> 16:42.160
There you go.

16:55.090 --> 16:55.550
Miss,

16:56.070 --> 16:57.050
can I use your phone?

16:59.740 --> 17:00.470

17:01.430 --> 17:02.580

17:02.730 --> 17:03.300

17:03.770 --> 17:04.700

17:06.180 --> 17:07.619
You! Stop!

17:07.839 --> 17:08.339
Stop!

17:10.030 --> 17:11.060
Robbery!

17:11.740 --> 17:13.000
Stop!

17:13.290 --> 17:14.280
Stop him!

17:14.310 --> 17:15.990
Stop!

17:18.670 --> 17:19.349
Catch him!

17:19.349 --> 17:20.270
Stop!

17:23.030 --> 17:24.200
Robbery!

17:24.619 --> 17:26.260
Stop!

17:49.830 --> 17:50.220

17:53.160 --> 17:54.350
Thank you.

17:56.610 --> 17:57.910
You want to use my phone, huh?

17:57.910 --> 17:58.510
Where's my phone?

17:58.510 --> 17:59.270
Give it back.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.140
Where's it?

18:01.670 --> 18:02.550
Tell me!

18:02.550 --> 18:03.470
Where's it?

18:03.610 --> 18:05.140
Come on,

18:05.170 --> 18:06.050
use your head.

18:07.850 --> 18:09.150
Clumsy as you, you think

18:09.310 --> 18:10.150
you can get out of this?

18:10.150 --> 18:11.110
How dare you.

18:11.110 --> 18:11.710
Where's my phone?

18:11.710 --> 18:12.720
Tell me!

18:15.060 --> 18:15.860
Where is it?

18:15.890 --> 18:16.860
There are only several pockets.

18:19.350 --> 18:20.070
Here it is.

18:20.200 --> 18:20.860
Thanks.

18:21.380 --> 18:22.570

Don't move.

18:27.460 --> 18:28.020
He's yours.

18:28.040 --> 18:28.330
OK,

18:28.360 --> 18:29.090
we'll have him.

- Get up.
- Did you get your things back?

18:31.990 --> 18:32.630
Yes.

18:32.790 --> 18:33.510
They are brought by you?

18:33.540 --> 18:34.080
Thank you.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.130
It's not a big deal.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.930
Thank you!

She's so cool,

18:45.690 --> 18:46.210
isn't she?

18:48.830 --> 18:50.380
He's Gu Chen, our monitor.

18:50.670 --> 18:51.810
He's very nice,

18:52.140 --> 18:54.690

19:15.990 --> 19:18.300
Zhu Jiafa,

19:20.610 --> 19:21.870

It's her?

19:32.950 --> 19:34.310
What a coincidence!

19:34.310 --> 19:34.880

19:35.160 --> 19:35.670
What oranges?

19:36.240 --> 19:36.980
Those two you use to

19:37.070 --> 19:38.770
practice suturing?

19:39.590 --> 19:40.660
I… I don't know.

19:44.930 --> 19:45.580
Senior…

19:46.230 --> 19:46.670
I…

19:47.580 --> 19:48.150
I accidentally

19:48.270 --> 19:49.950
threw them away

19:50.060 --> 19:51.660
when doing the cleaning.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.240
These two are the most similar to the original ones.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.360
Will they do?

19:56.230 --> 19:56.920
You are new here?

19:58.820 --> 20:00.240
You really don't use your head, do you?

20:02.510 --> 20:03.690
Who enrolled her?

20:09.790 --> 20:10.920
The standards of our lab

20:10.950 --> 20:11.810
have dropped to this degree?

20:37.350 --> 20:38.870
Now I'm screwed.

20:39.250 --> 20:39.990
I wish I will never ever

20:39.990 --> 20:41.030
see her again.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.050
The changes in your physiological data

don't have to be the signs

22:52.060 --> 22:53.140
of a crush.

They can also be resulted from

22:55.060 --> 22:56.260

You can't

24:05.950 --> 24:07.030
to

24:07.030 --> 24:08.120
reject me?

Stop eating.

No,

24:58.730 --> 25:00.140

But I think Xiao Yuhe

25:03.270 --> 25:04.360
was right.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.120
Think about it.

25:06.510 --> 25:08.110
You only knew him several days ago

25:08.110 --> 25:09.030

I wouldn't believe it if I were him.

I'll have it outside.

27:40.120 --> 27:40.870
Wait.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.270
Why are you using a spoon

instead of a straw

27:44.390 --> 27:45.010

last night.

29:04.070 --> 29:05.110
To tell

29:05.110 --> 29:06.030
whether one is into another

29:06.030 --> 29:07.160
through physiological data

29:07.190 --> 29:08.100
is a one-way experiment.

29:08.470 --> 29:09.990
When you are into someone,

29:09.990 --> 29:10.990
your heart beats faster,

29:10.990 --> 29:12.350
you have a higher blood oxygen level,

29:12.350 --> 29:13.670
and produce more hormones.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.190
But we can't jump to the conclusion

29:15.190 --> 29:16.550
that one is into another

29:16.550 --> 29:17.990
based on

29:17.990 --> 29:19.230
these simple changes.

29:19.590 --> 29:20.000
So

29:20.030 --> 29:21.220
even if

29:21.220 --> 29:22.350
all my experimental data

29:22.350 --> 29:23.000
meet the requirements,

29:23.370 --> 29:24.660
I still can't prove I'm into you.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.600
You are making me prove

29:29.710 --> 29:30.960
Seems you really did a lot of research.

29:31.270 --> 29:31.990
It is impossible to prove

29:31.990 --> 29:32.980
whether one is into another.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.510
What do you mean?

29:35.660 --> 29:36.470
You are in favor of me?

29:36.770 --> 29:38.280
We can't prove whether one is into another,

29:37.370 --> 29:39.420
[Brain and Intelligence Lab]

29:37.370 --> 29:39.420
[Likes proving experiments]

29:38.590 --> 29:39.630
but we can observe it.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.070
In 2003,

29:41.070 --> 29:41.910
Helen Fisher and her lab members

29:41.910 --> 29:43.270
scanned the brains of 17 couples

29:43.270 --> 29:44.420
through MRI

29:44.470 --> 29:45.070
and found apparent activation

29:45.070 --> 29:46.470
in the ventral tegmentum and caudate nucleus

29:46.510 --> 29:47.390
of the midbrain

29:47.420 --> 29:48.540
when they looked at

29:48.570 --> 29:49.720
the photos of their partners.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.110
And the more they love each other,

29:51.110 --> 29:52.350
the more active

29:52.350 --> 29:52.940
the two areas are.

29:53.070 --> 29:54.150
So through observation on

29:54.150 --> 29:55.550
the two areas

29:55.630 --> 29:56.620
we can tell whether

29:56.820 --> 29:57.950
one is into the other.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.630
We need to redo the experiment.

30:00.230 --> 30:01.120
Again?

30:02.310 --> 30:03.390
When we were

30:03.390 --> 30:04.630
doing the NIR brain function imaging,

30:04.630 --> 30:05.950
the ventral tegmentum

30:05.950 --> 30:07.270
and caudate nucleus of your midbrain were not activated.

30:07.330 --> 30:07.970
You explained

30:07.990 --> 30:09.110
it was due to the ambience in the lab,

30:09.150 --> 30:09.750
so we can cultivate the ambience

30:09.750 --> 30:10.630
between us before

30:10.630 --> 30:12.030
the next data collection.

30:12.950 --> 30:13.910
What do you mean?

30:14.020 --> 30:14.860
I mean going on a date,

30:15.110 --> 30:16.110
doing something

30:16.110 --> 30:16.860
common for couples

30:16.890 --> 30:18.290
to get us closer

30:18.380 --> 30:19.150
so that

30:19.150 --> 30:19.950
the relative functional areas

30:19.950 --> 30:20.950
in your brain

30:20.950 --> 30:22.150
will be fully activated

30:22.150 --> 30:23.350
when doing the NIR imaging.

30:29.580 --> 30:30.460
A date…

30:48.270 --> 30:49.030
You can decide

30:49.590 --> 30:50.710
the places you want to go

30:51.730 --> 30:52.580
and the things you want to do.

30:53.700 --> 30:54.410
Just let me know when you have decided.

30:55.360 --> 30:55.810
OK.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.490
My friends,

31:39.430 --> 31:40.900
he asked me out.

31:41.170 --> 31:42.300
On his own initiative.

31:55.800 --> 31:56.650
Have you decided where to go?

31:57.780 --> 31:58.670
I did some research.

31:58.670 --> 32:00.010
Red Brick Art Museum will do.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.660
There will be

32:01.690 --> 32:02.480
an installation art exhibition recently.

32:02.710 --> 32:04.430
It'll be nice

32:04.430 --> 32:05.630
to sit

32:05.630 --> 32:06.150
in the coffee shop nearby

32:06.220 --> 32:09.110
after seeing the exhibition.

32:09.710 --> 32:10.620
You are good.

32:10.640 --> 32:11.830
You really did a lot of research.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.460
That hurts.

32:14.400 --> 32:14.820
Chengcheng.

32:14.930 --> 32:15.330
Meizi.

32:15.670 --> 32:16.060
Monitor.

32:17.010 --> 32:18.330
The assignment of physics should be handed in tomorrow.

32:18.510 --> 32:19.800
And the time for the English test is also fixed.

32:20.110 --> 32:21.710
Only you two didn't reply in the class group.

32:21.920 --> 32:22.970
Oh God, stop, don't mention it.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.230
Didn't we just finish the internship

32:25.230 --> 32:26.310
of Electronic Technology

32:26.310 --> 32:27.450
of the second semester of the freshman year?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.700
And we handed in the assignments

32:29.760 --> 32:30.730
of Mathematic Statistics and biology a few days ago.

32:31.430 --> 32:33.000
I feel like I'm in Grade 12.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.180
I can't believe that.

32:35.510 --> 32:36.270
We are

32:36.270 --> 32:37.630
paying the tuition for one person,

32:37.630 --> 32:38.800
having a curriculum for two people,

32:38.820 --> 32:40.170
and doing assignments for four people.

32:40.390 --> 32:42.040
One minute there are assignments and exams,

32:42.070 --> 32:43.420
and the next there are experiments in the lab.

32:43.930 --> 32:44.890
I'm exhausted.

32:46.070 --> 32:46.740
But speaking of the lab,

32:46.950 --> 32:48.080
Chengcheng,

32:48.110 --> 32:49.150
the Brain and Intelligence Lab you picked

32:49.150 --> 32:49.800
is a national key subject.

32:50.410 --> 32:51.180
It's a good opportunity.

32:51.750 --> 32:52.790
Come on.

32:53.140 --> 32:55.220
All the members in my team are talented

32:55.530 --> 32:56.680
except me.

32:58.060 --> 32:59.050
Tell you what,

32:59.270 --> 33:00.070
there's a horrible senior

33:00.070 --> 33:01.640

33:05.870 --> 33:07.270
How come such a pretty face like you

33:07.390 --> 33:08.700
is so brazen?

33:09.510 --> 33:10.470
You will be over any boy you like,

33:10.470 --> 33:11.620
won't you?

33:11.850 --> 33:13.160
Who do you think you are to pursue Wang Jiaze?

33:15.220 --> 33:15.930
How dare she?

33:31.870 --> 33:32.630
Stop being mad.

33:34.090 --> 33:35.020
Calm yourself down.

33:53.510 --> 33:54.310
Will she think it was me

33:54.310 --> 33:55.160
who gave the cup to her?

33:57.860 --> 33:59.090
What should I do?

34:00.970 --> 34:01.800
What should I do?

34:04.030 --> 34:04.520
Chengcheng.

34:07.770 --> 34:08.460
Give it to her.

34:08.750 --> 34:09.630
- I don't dare.
- Talk to her.

34:09.870 --> 34:10.449
Talk to her.

34:10.610 --> 34:11.540
Just go!

34:26.449 --> 34:27.040
Senior.

34:27.440 --> 34:27.920
Um…

34:27.949 --> 34:29.239
- There's some tissue.
- Don't follow me.

34:39.630 --> 34:40.389
Jiafa.

34:43.510 --> 34:44.380
OK, I'm on my way.

35:01.130 --> 35:02.240
I don't understand.

35:02.650 --> 35:04.240
Do you think this lab

35:04.270 --> 35:05.540
is suitable for you to date someone

35:06.190 --> 35:06.830
or

35:06.830 --> 35:08.190
you feel like dating someone

35:08.340 --> 35:09.680
once you enter the lab?

35:18.650 --> 35:20.050
Why don't you speak?

35:20.860 --> 35:22.360
You think I'm giving you a hard time?

35:24.430 --> 35:26.980
Do not distract him.

35:27.380 --> 35:28.260
Do you know

35:29.190 --> 35:30.390
how much hope we have placed

35:30.390 --> 35:31.780
on Xiao Yuhe?

35:32.190 --> 35:33.080
Do you know

35:33.100 --> 35:34.010
how precious

35:34.050 --> 35:35.170
his time for experiment is?

35:36.300 --> 35:37.440
Stop doing that.

35:48.860 --> 35:49.780

35:50.950 --> 35:51.510

36:09.090 --> 36:10.110
have you decided on the location for the experiment?

36:11.030 --> 36:12.590

36:12.590 --> 36:13.630
that I haven't decided.

36:14.190 --> 36:14.840
Then leave it to me.

36:16.390 --> 36:17.350
I'll let you know when I have decided.

36:52.990 --> 36:54.110
Just admit you are into her.

36:54.110 --> 36:55.080
Why does it have to be so roundabout?

36:55.170 --> 36:55.670

Into me?

36:58.750 --> 36:59.660

The course Prof. Du teaches is a little difficult.

37:20.030 --> 37:20.590
I've borrowed

37:20.590 --> 37:21.710
the notes of a senior

37:21.710 --> 37:22.850
and plan to preview the lessons.

37:23.150 --> 37:24.110
I'll go with you.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.390

Your date.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.680
Ask him!

37:55.710 --> 37:57.110
You need to know where is the date

37:57.110 --> 37:58.200
