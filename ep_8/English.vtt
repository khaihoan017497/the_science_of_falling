Sorry.

02:05.210 --> 02:06.240
I'm in a hurry for class.

02:34.270 --> 02:34.710
It's okay.

02:34.990 --> 02:35.630
Thank you.

Chengcheng,

02:58.680 --> 02:59.220
Thank you.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.710
Senior, how do you know that

03:02.710 --> 03:03.500
I don't eat cilantro?

03:06.270 --> 03:07.700
Zhu Jiafa told me.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.510
Senior Jiafa is so kind to me.

03:15.550 --> 03:16.110
All right.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.650
I saw you taking pictures with your family

03:20.680 --> 03:22.120
at the school gate this morning.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.470
Why didn't you take a picture?

03:26.650 --> 03:28.030
That’s my father and my aunt.

03:31.490 --> 03:32.600
When the freshmen checked in,

03:32.630 --> 03:33.829
I was the only one in the class

03:33.860 --> 03:34.860
who checked in by myself.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.630
Many people took photos

03:37.630 --> 03:38.710
at the school gate at that time.

03:39.150 --> 03:39.790
But everyone was shooting

03:39.790 --> 03:40.900
with the whole family.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.540
I didn't really want to take pictures

03:42.540 --> 03:43.690
alone at that time.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.740
After the school year started,

03:47.750 --> 03:49.310
I thought it was a bit too touristy

03:49.310 --> 03:51.020
to take photos at the school gate,

03:52.240 --> 03:53.160
so I didn't take them either.

03:55.620 --> 03:56.720
So

03:57.980 --> 03:59.230
it seems that I really haven’t

03:59.230 --> 04:00.370
taken any serious photos at the school gate.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.370

05:15.900 --> 05:17.310
I don't eat mooncakes. You eat.

05:33.830 --> 05:34.990
I actually used to

05:34.990 --> 05:36.010
love festivals.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.520
Because when it comes to the festival,

05:38.630 --> 05:40.150
I had all kinds of reasons

05:40.150 --> 05:41.310
to ask my parents

05:41.460 --> 05:43.060
for gifts and pocket money.

05:45.190 --> 05:46.580
But then they got divorced,

05:46.830 --> 05:47.970
and I don't like the festivals anymore.

05:49.670 --> 05:50.390
Because I didn't know

05:50.390 --> 05:51.000
where to go.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.080
my family

06:04.110 --> 06:05.460
went to the top of the mountain to enjoy the moon.

06:06.230 --> 06:07.520
There was nothing really interesting.

06:08.390 --> 06:09.370
Our mountains are not high

06:10.030 --> 06:10.870
and there were many people.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.550
It was full of barbecue stalls and small stalls.

06:17.820 --> 06:18.860
So noisy.

06:19.570 --> 06:20.760
It was the same every year.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.600
So I got used to it.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.120
Then my parents got divorced,

06:30.350 --> 06:31.910
and I didn't want to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival,

06:33.460 --> 06:34.420
let alone eat mooncakes.

07:58.870 --> 07:59.850
How did you find this place?

08:01.300 --> 08:02.550
Once I escaped from self-study at night

08:02.550 --> 08:03.740
and wandered here.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.320

09:50.580 --> 09:52.010
into a small box

09:53.000 --> 09:53.910
and lock it with a key.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.310

18:47.010 --> 18:47.400
Yes.

18:48.340 --> 18:49.280
I'll fix it for you right now.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.210
Come on, get out of the way.

18:51.310 --> 18:51.720
Senior.

18:52.960 --> 18:53.920
Senior Xiao.

19:00.580 --> 19:02.650
Senior Xiao was hit by Jianming.

19:05.130 --> 19:05.780
How is it?

19:06.390 --> 19:07.060
He's still in there.

19:07.550 --> 19:08.260
Jianming hit him.

19:16.100 --> 19:16.750
I can't handle it.

19:18.270 --> 19:18.990
Are you okay?

19:19.110 --> 19:19.830
Did you get scratched?

19:20.350 --> 19:20.870
I'm fine.

19:21.140 --> 19:21.640
Close the door.

19:27.710 --> 19:28.080
Oh, my God!

19:28.100 --> 19:29.980
What are you doing? So noisy.

19:30.010 --> 19:30.540
What are you doing?

19:31.910 --> 19:32.470
Jianming.

19:32.500 --> 19:32.940
Look.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.420
Jianming is usually good.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.410
It is splashing water.

19:39.850 --> 19:40.910
Hurry up!

19:44.220 --> 19:45.110
Today Jianming is really...

19:46.500 --> 19:47.260
Chengcheng, are you okay?

19:54.390 --> 19:55.110
I'm not cold.

19:56.270 --> 19:56.810
Go back to the dormitory.

19:57.270 --> 19:58.100
That monkey...

19:58.180 --> 19:58.790
Go back.

19:59.670 --> 20:00.150
Go.

20:01.480 --> 20:01.880
Go back.

20:04.110 --> 20:04.630
Well...

20:06.070 --> 20:06.470
How...

20:08.230 --> 20:08.920
How about?

20:13.540 --> 20:14.020
How about?

20:14.950 --> 20:15.630
Jianming is really...

20:15.630 --> 20:16.460
There is a fly.

20:19.230 --> 20:20.510
Should I go?

20:20.650 --> 20:21.640
Okay!

20:26.430 --> 20:27.910
Is it just a monkey?

20:27.910 --> 20:28.340
Prof..

20:32.220 --> 20:34.120
Jianming, you can't do this.

20:36.330 --> 20:36.720
Put it down.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.140
Jianming!

20:41.630 --> 20:42.830
Are you crazy?

20:46.490 --> 20:48.020
You... you're for real!

20:50.060 --> 20:50.640
Prof. Du.

20:56.270 --> 20:56.750
Come on!

21:07.550 --> 21:08.890
Fuck you!

21:09.400 --> 21:10.200
Prof. Du, are you okay?

21:10.220 --> 21:11.740
Hurry up!

21:12.030 --> 21:13.870
Go get the keeper.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.770
Okay, let’s go.

21:20.450 --> 21:21.230
Don't all go.

21:22.110 --> 21:22.890
Come back one.

21:34.470 --> 21:35.510
Mr. Wang from the breeding room

21:35.510 --> 21:36.470
has gone home on vacation.

21:36.570 --> 21:37.780
Jianming hasn't seen him

21:37.800 --> 21:38.510
for a few days in a row,

21:38.630 --> 21:39.960
so it is anxious.

21:50.530 --> 21:51.450
Mr. Wang's clothes.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.890
Mr. Wang's keys.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.390
According to my observation,

22:07.840 --> 22:09.780
Jianming is most sensitive

22:09.980 --> 22:10.950
to smells and sounds.

22:20.150 --> 22:20.830
Play Jianming's

22:20.860 --> 22:22.010
favorite cartoon

22:22.270 --> 22:23.360
to attract its attention.

22:27.670 --> 22:28.350
The clothes

22:28.370 --> 22:29.870
have Jianming’s familiar smell,

22:30.240 --> 22:32.460
and the keys have its familiar sound.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.260
Just as I expected.

22:54.490 --> 22:55.490
It's done!

23:20.490 --> 23:20.960
You’re back.

23:23.230 --> 23:24.060
Whose clothes are you wearing?

23:24.910 --> 23:25.560
What's going on?

23:33.190 --> 23:35.840
This style looks familiar.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.250
Is it a man

23:37.270 --> 23:38.460
named Xiao's?

23:38.700 --> 23:39.660
I knew it.

23:39.860 --> 23:40.710
When I left,

23:40.710 --> 23:41.700
you two were acting weird.

23:42.090 --> 23:43.230
Is there something going on between you?

23:43.630 --> 23:44.630
What's going on with you and Xiao Yuhe?

23:45.140 --> 23:45.920
Tell me. Tell me.

23:48.210 --> 23:49.260
Why are your underwear transparent?

23:51.630 --> 23:52.470
No wonder Xiao Yuhe

23:52.470 --> 23:53.680
gave me his jacket.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.720
I'm too ashamed. I don't want to live anymore.

24:00.350 --> 24:01.140
You mean that

24:01.220 --> 24:01.950
Xiao Yuhe knew that

24:01.950 --> 24:02.790
your clothes were wet,

24:02.810 --> 24:03.580
so he took off his jacket

24:03.610 --> 24:04.790
and gave it to you?

24:05.760 --> 24:06.470
Is this the Xiao Yuhe

24:06.470 --> 24:07.900
you told me about before?

24:08.150 --> 24:09.130
He's changed his mind for you?

24:10.180 --> 24:12.250
What kind of idol drama is this?

24:12.280 --> 24:14.120
This is so romantic.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.370
Do I believe in love again?

24:16.830 --> 24:17.680
That's great.

24:19.100 --> 24:19.500
Look.

24:20.140 --> 24:20.610
Yes.

24:21.110 --> 24:22.070
The most important part

24:22.580 --> 24:23.950
is the new love skills

24:23.950 --> 24:24.810
learned from the script.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.610
The hero saves the beauty.

24:27.150 --> 24:29.350
The hero saves the beauty.

24:40.630 --> 24:41.620
Hello, Senior Xiao.

24:45.590 --> 24:45.990
Let's go.

24:48.750 --> 24:49.110
Let's go.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.190
Are you okay?

24:50.950 --> 24:52.180
Yes, I just have a cold.

24:52.470 --> 24:53.870
It is cold these days.

24:54.030 --> 24:55.430
Put on more clothes, don't catch a cold.

24:57.350 --> 24:58.080
Where's your jacket?

25:00.730 --> 25:01.560
I left it in the lab.

25:02.510 --> 25:03.730
Do you need to go back and get it?

25:03.910 --> 25:04.680
No, let's go.

25:05.790 --> 25:06.220
Let's go then.

25:07.710 --> 25:08.250
Let's go.

25:10.350 --> 25:13.340
Get on my beloved bike.

26:09.390 --> 26:10.950
Is the power of love so great?

26:11.060 --> 26:12.340
Su Chengcheng can get up by herself

26:12.370 --> 26:13.450
without an alarm clock.

26:13.700 --> 26:14.190
Li Meizi,

26:15.510 --> 26:15.810
I...

26:16.740 --> 26:18.230
I got his jacket dirty.

26:19.420 --> 26:20.380
Don’t worry, it's not obvious.

26:20.460 --> 26:22.220
Obvious, it’s obvious.

26:22.710 --> 26:23.190
Come down quickly.

26:23.210 --> 26:24.280
Go with me to wash the clothes.

26:26.760 --> 26:27.570
Kill me

26:27.670 --> 26:28.600
to cheer you up.

26:30.030 --> 26:31.590
Meizi, Li Meizi.

26:32.410 --> 26:33.810
Li Meizi, Meizi, Li Meizi.

26:33.840 --> 26:34.560
Meizi, Li Meizi.

26:34.670 --> 26:35.660
Meizi, Li Meizi, Li Meizi.

26:35.700 --> 26:36.180
Li Meizi.

26:36.980 --> 26:37.390
Okay.

26:38.990 --> 26:39.700
Hurry up.

26:49.780 --> 26:50.990
Put more clothes in it.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.190
One piece won't get the machine running.

26:52.230 --> 26:52.710
That’s enough.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.030
Why are they all white?

26:57.150 --> 26:58.340
I'm afraid that

26:58.360 --> 26:59.400
if the other clothes lose color,

26:59.420 --> 27:00.410
it will be stained.

27:01.660 --> 27:02.470
Disgusting.

27:02.950 --> 27:04.660
Show your love here.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.460
Show off by washing clothes.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.770
The lab has a temporary meeting.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.120
I have to go there.

27:15.950 --> 27:16.740
When the laundry is done,

27:16.760 --> 27:18.090
please help me take it out to dry.

27:18.210 --> 27:18.470
Okay.

27:18.590 --> 27:19.270
Don't forget.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.020
Don't worry.

27:26.000 --> 27:26.730
I feel like

27:27.790 --> 27:29.940
the left brain is used to listen to language

27:29.970 --> 27:31.320
and music.

27:31.830 --> 27:32.310
Really?

27:32.720 --> 27:33.370
Yes, the left ear...

27:36.360 --> 27:37.040
Two people.

27:37.230 --> 27:39.170
Senior,

27:39.200 --> 27:40.820
I was going to return the clothes to you.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.220
But it's a little bit dirty.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.130
Can I wash it

27:43.160 --> 27:43.870
and then bring it back to you?

27:44.310 --> 27:44.680
Okay.

27:48.310 --> 27:49.110
What's wrong with you?

27:49.780 --> 27:50.510
Did you give me your jacket yesterday,

27:50.510 --> 27:51.710
and you got cold?

27:52.670 --> 27:54.400
No, I'm allergic to pollen.

27:56.190 --> 27:57.420
Isn't it autumn now?

27:59.270 --> 27:59.760
Chrysanthemum.

28:00.470 --> 28:00.960
Chrysanthemum?

28:01.950 --> 28:03.130
There are no chrysanthemums in our school.

28:06.990 --> 28:07.590
Osmanthus.

28:07.760 --> 28:08.870
There is no osmanthus either.

28:09.740 --> 28:11.600
Newly planted osmanthus? Where?

28:21.260 --> 28:23.240
We're all here now.

28:24.630 --> 28:24.930
Okay.

28:25.430 --> 28:26.750
Before we start,

28:26.770 --> 28:27.420
let me tell you

28:27.450 --> 28:28.440
one little thing.

28:28.590 --> 28:30.070
Last week, I went to Shanghai with your senior sister

28:30.070 --> 28:31.860
to attend a meeting.

28:32.230 --> 28:33.030
I accidentally mentioned

28:33.050 --> 28:34.220
the love experiment

28:34.250 --> 28:35.970
in our lab before.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.190
The experiment

28:38.190 --> 28:39.040
Yuhe and Su Chengcheng did.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.260
Many people are interested in it,

28:45.970 --> 28:47.290
and hope that

28:47.390 --> 28:48.350
our experiment

28:48.370 --> 28:49.130
can be extended further.

28:50.550 --> 28:51.710
Because

28:51.710 --> 28:52.980
in terms of the current technology,

28:53.440 --> 28:55.490
it is indeed impossible to define liking.

28:56.340 --> 28:57.160
But it doesn't prevent us

28:57.180 --> 28:58.320
from observing it

28:58.340 --> 28:59.490
from different angles.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.440
I have found a small direction.

29:02.630 --> 29:03.920
To study the difference in brain activity

29:03.940 --> 29:05.710
between men and women

29:06.020 --> 29:07.610
when processing romantic information.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.670
In this way,

29:09.700 --> 29:10.750
we can accumulate some data,

29:11.150 --> 29:11.940
which is also

29:11.940 --> 29:12.740
helpful for our research.

29:13.390 --> 29:15.250
At the weekly sharing meeting,

29:15.510 --> 29:17.030
you can share

29:17.030 --> 29:17.570
your observations

29:17.690 --> 29:18.920
with us.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.130
It's time to start dating at public expense again,

29:23.900 --> 29:25.860
and abuse singles openly

29:25.900 --> 29:27.870
under the guise of academics.

29:30.230 --> 29:31.070
Actually,

29:31.290 --> 29:32.280
the most important part

29:32.300 --> 29:33.510
of this experiment

29:33.710 --> 29:35.190
is to study the similarities and differences

29:35.510 --> 29:37.650
in the activation of different parts of the brain

29:37.920 --> 29:39.800
during the processing of romantic information by the opposite sex.

29:39.950 --> 29:41.330
It doesn't have much to do

29:41.430 --> 29:43.090
with liking.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.100
If you are interested,

29:45.630 --> 29:46.580
just participate in the experiment.

29:46.990 --> 29:47.780
Look,

29:48.120 --> 29:49.540
our dean still cares about

29:49.560 --> 29:50.870
us singles .

29:54.230 --> 29:56.110
Okay, you all go back

29:56.130 --> 29:56.750
and get ready.

29:56.850 --> 29:58.480
You can divide up into groups, okay?

29:58.810 --> 29:59.130
Okay.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.330
Okay, let's get back to the subject.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.550
Let's discuss

30:02.760 --> 30:03.680
some key points

30:03.710 --> 30:05.540
of our academic research

30:05.560 --> 30:06.560
last week.

30:12.810 --> 30:14.330
Students, you're all so serious.

30:14.430 --> 30:15.120
Hello, Prof. Du.

30:15.710 --> 30:16.750
Go on with your work.

30:16.980 --> 30:17.680
Go on with your work.

30:18.020 --> 30:19.750
Nothing, I'm here

30:20.240 --> 30:21.250
to check some data

30:21.300 --> 30:22.190
from our previous studio.

30:22.750 --> 30:23.350
Senior Xiao

30:23.380 --> 30:24.530
has been using this machine.

30:25.070 --> 30:26.000
Okay, go on with your work.

30:26.090 --> 30:26.490
Okay.

31:28.590 --> 31:29.340
Go on with your work.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.110
Okay.

31:30.140 --> 31:30.620
Okay.

31:45.110 --> 31:45.520
Xiao,

31:47.630 --> 31:48.930
Prof. Du asks you to go to the office.

32:23.130 --> 32:23.950
Are you still

32:25.310 --> 32:26.110
developing Musk

32:26.110 --> 32:27.290
by yourself in secret?

32:29.220 --> 32:30.180
Why are you doing this?

32:30.870 --> 32:32.310
Do you still want to

32:32.310 --> 32:33.360
participate in this year's competition?

32:34.650 --> 32:34.950
Yes.

32:34.990 --> 32:35.980
Nonsense!

32:37.160 --> 32:38.850
You're completely fooling around!

32:41.100 --> 32:41.990
Xiao Yuhe,

32:43.390 --> 32:45.740
I'm not stopping you from pursuing your dream.

32:47.050 --> 32:47.980
I hope you

32:47.980 --> 32:49.220
realize your dreams.

32:49.730 --> 32:51.040
I also hope that

32:51.230 --> 32:52.830
one day you will become a valuable

32:52.870 --> 32:55.030
and successful

32:55.030 --> 32:55.900
researcher.

32:57.050 --> 32:58.240
But have you thought about

32:58.990 --> 33:00.430
what you will face

33:00.430 --> 33:01.010
if you go to

33:01.550 --> 33:02.760
this competition now?

33:03.150 --> 33:03.990
Don't forget

33:03.990 --> 33:05.060
the incident

33:05.350 --> 33:06.820
happened three years ago,

33:07.390 --> 33:09.120
which had a very bad impact.

33:09.470 --> 33:10.390
If you go to the competition

33:10.390 --> 33:11.490
at this time,

33:12.280 --> 33:13.670
there are many difficulties

33:13.670 --> 33:16.100
that you can't even imagine.

33:16.390 --> 33:17.430
Even if you think about it,

33:17.430 --> 33:18.520
you can not solve it.

33:28.350 --> 33:28.810
Senior,

33:30.190 --> 33:31.210
what’s going on?

33:33.250 --> 33:33.970
Several years ago,

33:34.230 --> 33:35.820
Senior Xiao

33:35.840 --> 33:36.700
took part in a competition.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.460
The robot he made

33:38.660 --> 33:39.880
lost control on the spot

33:40.270 --> 33:41.250
and hurt people.

33:41.950 --> 33:43.630
Crucially, he clashed

33:43.650 --> 33:44.560
with the staff.

33:45.480 --> 33:46.910
Then things got worse and worse.

33:47.430 --> 33:48.410
He even went abroad to study

33:48.440 --> 33:49.280
for a few years.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.170
He just went back to school this year.

33:54.270 --> 33:55.780
Why did the robot go out of control?

33:56.240 --> 33:57.200
The robot went out of control...

34:02.980 --> 34:04.850
I don't know exactly what happened.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.380
I heard it from someone else.

34:07.060 --> 34:07.730
I really don't know.

34:26.310 --> 34:27.880
Meizi, what's wrong?

34:34.270 --> 34:35.639
What about the other clothes? Are they all there?

34:35.920 --> 34:36.770
Only that one is gone.

34:38.630 --> 34:39.650
How could this happen?

34:41.070 --> 34:41.989
Don't worry, don't worry.

34:41.989 --> 34:42.710
I'm going back to the dorm.

34:43.030 --> 34:43.630
Don't worry.

34:44.659 --> 34:45.260
Okay, okay, okay.

34:52.420 --> 34:52.880
What happened?

34:53.750 --> 34:55.150
Just now I deliberately set a time

34:55.150 --> 34:55.739
to come to pick it up.

34:55.739 --> 34:56.989
When I came over,

34:57.030 --> 34:57.590
your clothes

34:57.590 --> 34:58.870
had all been put aside.

34:58.870 --> 35:00.190
And Xiao Yuhe's jacket

35:00.190 --> 35:00.640
was gone.

35:03.270 --> 35:04.180
Don’t worry, let’s find it.

35:17.470 --> 35:20.070
I've told you everything.

35:22.980 --> 35:23.690
In fact,

35:25.670 --> 35:27.500
I quite understand your insistence.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.090
Researchers

35:30.960 --> 35:32.220
should have the spirit of

35:32.240 --> 35:33.330
not being afraid to lose.

35:34.570 --> 35:35.800
But this is

35:35.940 --> 35:36.680
the situation now.

35:39.220 --> 35:39.820
I think,

35:40.950 --> 35:41.660
for one thing,

35:42.720 --> 35:43.830
the technical difficulty of Musk

35:43.860 --> 35:44.650
is too much

35:45.680 --> 35:47.440
for you to deal with alone.

35:48.180 --> 35:48.750
For another thing,

35:49.230 --> 35:50.790
I am also very worried about it.

35:51.670 --> 35:53.640
If you participate in this competition,

35:54.230 --> 35:55.510
if someone

35:55.620 --> 35:56.550
with ulterior motives

35:57.790 --> 35:59.170
digs up what happened back then,

36:00.230 --> 36:02.680
it will be harmful to you

36:03.430 --> 36:04.440
and to our lab.

36:05.270 --> 36:05.710
Right?

36:17.020 --> 36:18.070
Given your character,

36:18.910 --> 36:19.710
even if I ask you

36:20.000 --> 36:20.610
to give up now,

36:22.630 --> 36:23.150
you won't do it.

36:26.870 --> 36:27.290
Well,

36:28.880 --> 36:30.230
let's stop for a while.

36:30.810 --> 36:31.710
You think about it.

36:32.100 --> 36:32.970
I'll think about it too.

36:35.340 --> 36:36.250
When we figure it out,

36:36.710 --> 36:37.660
then let’s talk about it

36:38.060 --> 36:38.810
sometime,

36:39.470 --> 36:41.370
and see what we can do about it.

36:44.860 --> 36:45.500
But,

36:47.300 --> 36:48.570
until we come to a conclusion,

36:51.710 --> 36:52.350
I want you

36:52.350 --> 36:53.670
to put down

36:53.670 --> 36:54.100
the door card of the mechanical lab.

38:04.000 --> 38:04.490
It's okay.

38:04.660 --> 38:05.120
It's okay.

38:09.190 --> 38:09.760
Where's Su Chengcheng?

38:10.330 --> 38:11.020
She's going to...

38:11.190 --> 38:13.030
Su Chengcheng has gone back to the dorm.

38:15.750 --> 38:16.790
Senior Xiao,

38:17.190 --> 38:18.550
what's wrong

38:18.580 --> 38:19.430
with  Su Chengcheng?

38:19.820 --> 38:21.610
She's not active in her studies,

38:22.060 --> 38:23.760
but she's lazier than anyone else.

38:25.510 --> 38:26.050
Are you done?

38:27.470 --> 38:28.690
Yes.

38:35.750 --> 38:36.310
Go on with your work.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.530
Whose jacket is this?

39:02.470 --> 39:03.190
Here it is.
