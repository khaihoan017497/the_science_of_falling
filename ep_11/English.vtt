[The Science of Falling in Love]

01:45.180 --> 01:47.720
[Episode 11]

01:49.950 --> 01:50.990
Come on, Su Chengcheng.

01:51.470 --> 01:52.910
Let out all your anger

01:53.020 --> 01:53.979
from the past few days!

02:08.270 --> 02:09.570
Are you playing coquettish?

02:10.860 --> 02:11.260
Harder!

02:11.920 --> 02:12.280
One more time!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.200
One, two!

02:14.710 --> 02:15.130
Again!

02:15.740 --> 02:16.180
Again!

02:16.940 --> 02:17.340
I...

02:26.920 --> 02:27.300
One more time!

02:27.990 --> 02:28.690
One, two!

02:29.030 --> 02:29.410
Hit it!

02:30.460 --> 02:30.950
One more time!

02:31.700 --> 02:32.230
Use your leg!

02:35.780 --> 02:36.220
Good job!

02:37.350 --> 02:37.980
You feel good?

02:38.520 --> 02:39.010
Yes.

02:39.230 --> 02:40.310
I feel like I can do it again.

02:41.020 --> 02:41.680
Okay.

02:42.450 --> 02:43.380
Do you want to stay?

02:49.050 --> 02:49.380
Stay?

02:51.140 --> 02:51.810
Stay

02:53.780 --> 02:54.520
and follow Xiao Yuhe

02:55.410 --> 02:56.180
or

02:57.160 --> 02:58.090
come to my group.

03:05.790 --> 03:06.940
Follow you?

03:22.750 --> 03:23.360
You don't want to?

03:24.710 --> 03:25.230
It’s okay.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.070
Anyway, the NSF program

03:28.070 --> 03:29.590
have extra credits,

03:29.790 --> 03:31.490
which are helpful for getting postgraduate recommendation and going abroad.

03:33.130 --> 03:33.690
And

03:33.750 --> 03:35.350
there are also creative credits.

03:36.230 --> 03:36.630
I think there are other students

03:36.630 --> 03:37.640
who want to join us.

03:38.150 --> 03:38.700
I don't force you.

03:38.790 --> 03:40.130
I...

03:40.260 --> 03:41.030
I want to come.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.270
Thank you, Senior Xixi.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.160
No need to thank me.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.300
See you in the lab.

03:54.020 --> 03:54.750
When can I

03:54.780 --> 03:56.270
be as handsome as Senior Xixi?

04:04.640 --> 04:05.330
It's done.

04:05.510 --> 04:07.030
Don't forget what you promised me.

04:08.090 --> 04:08.500
Okay.

04:27.170 --> 04:28.240
Chengcheng, what are you doing?

04:29.160 --> 04:30.020
Packing up my things

04:30.130 --> 04:31.130
to go back to the lab.

04:31.990 --> 04:33.300
Didn't you fail to change the lab?

04:34.030 --> 04:35.070
She didn't change it.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.830
She's still in the same lab.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.690
What about Xiao Yuhe?

04:40.830 --> 04:41.909
Didn't you and he already

04:41.940 --> 04:42.760
have a standoff?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.110
Even if I go back,

04:46.110 --> 04:47.230
I won't be in his group.

04:47.270 --> 04:48.370
I'll go to Senior Xixi's group.

04:50.550 --> 04:51.310
Now,

04:51.440 --> 04:52.240
I’ve gotten over it.

04:53.030 --> 04:53.830
Xiao Yuhe

04:53.830 --> 04:54.590
such a small trouble

04:54.590 --> 04:55.360
is not even

04:55.380 --> 04:56.470
in my consideration.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.080
When I see him now,

04:58.110 --> 04:58.700
I just

04:59.070 --> 04:59.980
ignore him.

05:02.510 --> 05:03.230
That's good.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.560
I heard that

05:04.610 --> 05:05.690
Senior Xixi's research

05:05.720 --> 05:07.310
is mainly about

05:07.330 --> 05:08.410
EEG analysis and recognition of mouse behavior.

05:08.610 --> 05:09.370
If you

05:09.400 --> 05:10.310
study with her,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.340
you'll definitely improve a lot.

05:12.670 --> 05:13.810
I looked it up.

05:14.110 --> 05:15.750
There are a lot of English in this area.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.390
Aren't you preparing for IELTS?

05:17.420 --> 05:18.570
You must have a very large vocabulary.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.090
If I don’t know anything,

05:20.110 --> 05:20.860
I will ask you.

05:27.530 --> 05:28.730
Anyway, in the future,

05:28.750 --> 05:29.630
I no longer have to

05:29.630 --> 05:30.590
follow Xiao Yuhe

05:30.610 --> 05:32.310
to collect data and run data.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.540
Mice, I'm coming.

05:44.310 --> 05:44.990
Sitting here again?

05:48.830 --> 05:49.460
Isn't this the jacket

05:49.460 --> 05:50.610
that Chengcheng bought for you?

05:50.810 --> 05:52.260
It’s new, why did you dry clean it?

05:52.560 --> 05:53.610
Because someone I don't like

05:53.630 --> 05:54.370
tried it on.

06:07.230 --> 06:07.680
Xiao,

06:08.790 --> 06:09.770
as your senior,

06:10.210 --> 06:11.130
I have to enlighten you.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.420
You are

06:13.750 --> 06:14.760
usually good at everything,

06:15.030 --> 06:16.040
but you are too boring.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.110
I think that

06:17.310 --> 06:18.290
you are a typical

06:18.310 --> 06:19.220
lack of security.

06:20.770 --> 06:21.930
I've read a paper before

06:22.370 --> 06:23.860
which is about the people who are quite similar to you.

06:24.540 --> 06:24.910
It’s said that

06:25.320 --> 06:26.500
there is a type of people

06:26.830 --> 06:28.680
who want to be loved,

06:28.990 --> 06:29.470
but when others

06:29.470 --> 06:30.670
respond to you,

06:30.900 --> 06:31.780
you reject them.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.450
When others reject you,

06:33.570 --> 06:34.890
you don’t want to be abandoned.

06:35.120 --> 06:35.760
You are

06:35.780 --> 06:36.590
contradicting yourself.

06:37.420 --> 06:38.170
Take the case

06:38.200 --> 06:39.400
between you and Su Chengcheng before.

06:40.510 --> 06:41.460
You are the one

06:41.490 --> 06:42.740
who helped her clean the data.

06:43.200 --> 06:43.740
But

06:44.490 --> 06:45.210
you didn't even tell her.

06:45.909 --> 06:46.680
To help her change the lab,

06:46.800 --> 06:48.180
you did a lot of work,

06:48.500 --> 06:49.960
but you still didn’t tell her,

06:50.230 --> 06:51.820
which blew it all up.

06:52.260 --> 06:52.909
Well,

06:53.270 --> 06:54.480
you can't always act like

06:55.360 --> 06:55.950
I'm helping you,

06:56.150 --> 06:57.050
but I won't tell you.

06:57.790 --> 06:58.550
Just for fun.

06:58.950 --> 06:59.750
How... how can you

06:59.750 --> 07:00.540
let others understand you?

07:01.070 --> 07:01.570
Right?

07:04.240 --> 07:04.660
Right?

07:09.050 --> 07:10.180
Express yourself truthfully

07:10.210 --> 07:11.160
to Chengcheng.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.170
It's not that hard.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.160
Good morning, everyone.

07:19.160 --> 07:19.950
Good morning, Chengcheng.

07:20.590 --> 07:21.190
You're back.

07:21.190 --> 07:21.570
Yes.

07:26.940 --> 07:27.760
Senior Jiafa,

07:29.070 --> 07:30.250
I bought you some milk tea.

07:30.980 --> 07:32.110
As soon as Chengcheng comes back,

07:32.110 --> 07:33.190
my treatment

07:33.190 --> 07:34.020
comes back.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.170
Senior Dongmao,

07:37.110 --> 07:38.280
my gift for you

07:38.310 --> 07:40.030
is a wired headset.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.030
Thank you.

07:41.590 --> 07:41.990
Nothing.

07:42.310 --> 07:42.940
This is good.

07:46.430 --> 07:47.100
Senior Zhang Li,

07:47.840 --> 07:49.560
this packet of pumpkin seeds is for you.

07:49.710 --> 07:50.580
It's a local specialty,

07:50.600 --> 07:51.540
which is hard to buy.

07:51.690 --> 07:52.980
And it has thin skin and thick flesh.

07:53.010 --> 07:54.390
It's delicious. Try it.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.750
Okay, thank you, Chengcheng.

07:56.370 --> 07:56.840
Nothing.

07:58.570 --> 07:59.140
Senior,

08:00.010 --> 08:00.900
this hand cream

08:01.250 --> 08:02.870
is bread scented. It smells good.

08:02.870 --> 08:03.470
After applying it,

08:03.470 --> 08:04.700
you'll look lovely.

08:04.950 --> 08:05.880
I think it suits you.

08:06.030 --> 08:07.470
How can a hand cream

08:07.470 --> 08:08.610
smell like bread?

08:13.460 --> 08:14.770
Rum cheese flavor.

08:17.210 --> 08:17.900
It smells good.

08:17.930 --> 08:18.320
Right?

08:21.540 --> 08:22.220
Thank you.

08:23.110 --> 08:23.710
You're welcome.

08:43.770 --> 08:44.650
Senior Xixi,

08:45.030 --> 08:46.660
this hand brewed coffee,

08:47.560 --> 08:48.080
I bought it for you.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.920
I don't need it.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.110
After being a butterfly,

08:52.140 --> 08:53.930
come to the lab later.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.540
Are you comfortable?

09:07.970 --> 09:08.560
Catch it.

09:26.360 --> 09:26.920
Senior,

09:27.240 --> 09:28.370
after I catch it,

09:28.550 --> 09:29.180
then what should I do?

09:29.260 --> 09:29.990
First anesthetize it,

09:29.990 --> 09:31.390
then position it in three dimensions

09:31.390 --> 09:32.840
and disinfect its head.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.390
Cut a small opening

09:33.390 --> 09:34.820
and use a dental drill to make a hole.

09:37.970 --> 09:38.350
Scared?

09:43.330 --> 09:43.890
It doesn’t matter.

09:44.670 --> 09:45.860
I had a graduate student

09:45.860 --> 09:46.310
who also didn't dare to do it.

09:46.310 --> 09:47.070
Then Pro. Du sent him

09:47.070 --> 09:47.630
to medical school

09:47.630 --> 09:49.440
to kill mice for two years. Then...

09:51.900 --> 09:52.460
Well,

09:52.920 --> 09:53.890
let me send you there too?

09:53.990 --> 09:55.100
To learn about behavioral therapy.

09:55.270 --> 09:56.230
No, no, no.

09:56.230 --> 09:57.390
I... I can do it.

10:27.790 --> 10:28.180
Hello,

10:28.200 --> 10:29.530
what ingredients do you want?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.300
Pearls, taro balls...

10:47.370 --> 10:48.050
All of them.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.360
Are you sure?

10:50.520 --> 10:51.640
All ingredients?

10:52.210 --> 10:52.620
Yes.

10:53.860 --> 10:54.330
Okay.

11:02.200 --> 11:02.750
Hello,

11:03.010 --> 11:04.530
your ingredients are a little too much

11:04.750 --> 11:05.830
for our cups.

11:05.830 --> 11:06.960
I use an extra-large cup.

11:07.230 --> 11:07.900
Take it.

11:08.150 --> 11:08.690
Thank you.

11:15.140 --> 11:15.660
Chengcheng.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.430
Gu Chen, why are you here?

11:19.400 --> 11:20.630
Last time I did the experiment,

11:20.670 --> 11:21.760
and found it really interesting,

11:21.790 --> 11:22.810
so I applied to the school

11:22.840 --> 11:23.460
to transfer over.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.520
Senior Xixi is not here?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.860
She just went out for something.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.050
Did you apply

11:30.070 --> 11:31.230
and transfer here directly?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.770
What's your GPA?

11:34.450 --> 11:35.330
4.9.

11:37.910 --> 11:38.500
Sure enough,

11:39.110 --> 11:39.830
opportunities are always reserved

11:39.830 --> 11:40.890
for those who have a good GPA.

11:49.740 --> 11:50.250
Chengcheng,

11:50.590 --> 11:51.580
are you going to

11:51.610 --> 11:52.680
implant electrodes in mice?

11:54.960 --> 11:55.910
You need to prepare the skin first,

11:55.990 --> 11:57.460
and then fix it with a brain stereotaxic.

11:59.040 --> 11:59.420
Well,

11:59.660 --> 12:00.540
let me show you how to do it.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.080
Come on, you do it.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.270
Gu Chen, you are really my savior.

12:06.070 --> 12:07.310
After removing the hair here,

12:07.590 --> 12:08.730
make an incision

12:08.760 --> 12:09.520
along this sagittal suture,

12:09.730 --> 12:10.930
and then peel the fascia and muscle

12:10.960 --> 12:11.860
from the skull.

12:14.310 --> 12:15.590
I don't see any hydrogen peroxide here.

12:15.740 --> 12:16.570
Go and get one.

12:16.780 --> 12:17.080
Okay.

12:32.410 --> 12:33.120
Hello, Senior Xiao.

12:39.930 --> 12:40.890
What are you doing here?

12:41.100 --> 12:41.910
I applied to be transferred

12:41.940 --> 12:42.740
to our lab.

12:42.940 --> 12:44.190
I've already told Du Zhuanjia.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.600
He said I'll follow you in the future.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.610
If you need anything,

12:46.630 --> 12:47.410
just tell me.

12:48.690 --> 12:49.170
Gu Chen,

12:49.530 --> 12:51.070
in fact, you can can learn more things

12:51.070 --> 12:52.110
in Senior Xixi's group.

12:52.110 --> 12:53.230
Why don't you tell the teacher

12:53.230 --> 12:53.940
to transfer to our group?

12:57.950 --> 12:58.410
Gu Chen,

12:58.980 --> 12:59.790
please

12:59.790 --> 13:01.430
go and change the padding for the mice first.

13:01.600 --> 13:01.870
Okay.

13:02.260 --> 13:02.790
Wait.

13:04.420 --> 13:05.600
Gu Chen hasn't decided

13:05.630 --> 13:06.510
to go to your group yet,

13:06.850 --> 13:07.850
why are you asking him to do that?

13:08.190 --> 13:08.830
Besides,

13:09.140 --> 13:10.740
the mice are the business of our group,

13:10.740 --> 13:11.580
it's not your business.

13:11.970 --> 13:13.010
I don't think

13:13.040 --> 13:14.020
he needs to change the padding.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.750
He has already said that

13:16.090 --> 13:16.810
he is under my charge.

13:17.320 --> 13:17.780
So

13:18.250 --> 13:18.870
he has to do

13:18.890 --> 13:19.610
whatever I tell him to do.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.230
Please go and change the padding.

13:22.100 --> 13:22.510
Okay.

13:23.490 --> 13:24.070
It's okay, Chengcheng.

13:24.230 --> 13:24.860
I'll go change it.

13:32.700 --> 13:33.780
Inexplicable.

13:36.710 --> 13:37.650
I need to collect

13:37.690 --> 13:38.640
EEG data from the olfactory layer

13:38.660 --> 13:39.810
of mice during sleep.

13:40.430 --> 13:40.930
Cooperate with me.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.830
Sorry,

13:43.830 --> 13:45.030
I'm not very good at it.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.250
Aren't you a whiz?

13:46.410 --> 13:47.220
You can do it yourself.

13:47.510 --> 13:48.270
Fine.

13:48.270 --> 13:49.590
Someone else is good at it.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.230
I'll tell Zhang Xixi later that

13:51.310 --> 13:52.200
you don't cooperate with me,

13:52.380 --> 13:53.430
and let her cooperate with me herself.

14:02.790 --> 14:03.340
I go with you.

14:17.450 --> 14:18.370
I can't send it off.

14:55.950 --> 14:56.510
Senior Xiao,

14:58.460 --> 14:59.050
I've changed it.

15:04.260 --> 15:05.320
Prof. Wang has a data,

15:05.350 --> 15:05.930
go to get it.

15:06.230 --> 15:06.740
I just ran into Senior Dongmao

15:06.740 --> 15:07.620
on the way.

15:07.650 --> 15:08.550
He also told me about it.

15:08.830 --> 15:10.590
So I got it back

15:11.460 --> 15:12.330
on the way to change the padding.

15:20.990 --> 15:21.660
Our lab

15:21.660 --> 15:22.990
has opened a new experiment

15:24.260 --> 15:25.590
related to neural pathway damage

15:25.590 --> 15:27.210
in spinal cord injury.

15:27.910 --> 15:28.840
Gather some information

15:29.050 --> 15:30.070
and write a literature review.

15:30.270 --> 15:31.510
When I first transferred to the lab,

15:31.510 --> 15:32.830
I talked with Prof. Du about this topic,

15:32.920 --> 15:33.880
and he also told me about it.

15:34.660 --> 15:35.210
So,

15:35.550 --> 15:36.780
I made some preparations in advance.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.260
Look, Senior Xiao,

15:38.260 --> 15:39.350
if there's not enough,

15:39.470 --> 15:39.990
I'll find more.

15:51.020 --> 15:51.830
Gu Chen, are you done?

16:01.050 --> 16:01.800
Whose milk tea?

16:03.230 --> 16:04.230
Who knows?

16:05.560 --> 16:06.180
Yuhe,

16:06.410 --> 16:06.930
didn't you

16:06.950 --> 16:07.820
just bring it here yourself?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.240
Someone

16:20.270 --> 16:21.110
said before that

16:21.270 --> 16:23.310
the daily caffeine intake

16:23.310 --> 16:24.110
of a healthy adult

16:24.110 --> 16:25.540
should not exceed 200 milligrams.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.590
But the caffeine content

16:26.590 --> 16:27.550
of milk tea

16:27.550 --> 16:28.670
is 300 milligrams.

16:28.790 --> 16:30.150
In order to get a good sleep,

16:30.190 --> 16:31.420
he never drinks milk tea.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.360
This is the one I often drink.

16:41.380 --> 16:42.330
I have to

16:43.620 --> 16:45.110
experiment late today,

16:46.070 --> 16:47.050
so I bought a cup on the way.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.420
Such a big cup.

16:48.980 --> 16:49.540
Stay up all night?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.410
Why don't you drink it?

16:52.910 --> 16:53.810
I ate too much this morning,

16:53.830 --> 16:54.890
I couldn't drink it.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.470
I'll see if you drink it later.

16:56.470 --> 16:57.390
When I drink it is none of your business.

16:57.390 --> 16:58.510
Who cares when you drink?

16:58.510 --> 16:59.270
I will drink it

16:59.270 --> 16:59.830
whenever I want.

16:59.850 --> 17:00.800
I don’t care.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.040
I want to drink now, I drink now.

17:02.080 --> 17:02.720
Drink it.

17:10.609 --> 17:11.800
Fine.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.420
Delicious.

17:33.350 --> 17:34.230
Annoying!

17:36.640 --> 17:38.100
Gu Chen, have you eaten?

17:38.430 --> 17:38.880
No.

17:39.110 --> 17:39.810
Let's go eat.

17:40.040 --> 17:40.320
Okay.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.790
Our counselor

18:00.810 --> 18:02.330
is very strict with us.

18:04.160 --> 18:04.620
What's wrong?

18:06.380 --> 18:07.830
I feel like someone is following me.

18:09.120 --> 18:09.630
I don't think so.

18:10.060 --> 18:10.630
You're looking at it wrong.

18:11.960 --> 18:12.700
Yuhe,

18:13.380 --> 18:14.760
where are we going to eat?

18:15.900 --> 18:16.740
We're almost done.

18:16.870 --> 18:18.270
I want to eat something spicy.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.220
Let's find a heavy one.

18:20.770 --> 18:21.630
Spicy. We just

18:21.910 --> 18:22.950
passed a skewer store.

18:22.950 --> 18:23.500
Isn't it...

18:23.530 --> 18:24.350
Isn't it quite good?

18:26.140 --> 18:26.420
Yes.

18:29.710 --> 18:30.890
Hey, hey!

18:34.340 --> 18:35.180
Maybe it's a mistake.

18:36.070 --> 18:36.380
Let's go.

18:37.030 --> 18:37.590
Nothing.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.530
I thought someone was calling.

18:43.590 --> 18:44.350
What's wrong with you?

18:44.650 --> 18:45.330
Nothing. Nothing.

18:48.190 --> 18:48.910
We're lost.

18:48.910 --> 18:49.790
Just find one to eat.

18:49.790 --> 18:50.740
Come on, let's eat there.

18:50.870 --> 18:51.230
Let's go.

18:52.350 --> 18:53.040
What do you want to eat?

18:54.350 --> 18:55.110
I heard that

18:55.110 --> 18:56.670
their fig and quinoa salad is very popular.

18:55.430 --> 18:57.110
[Light Salad]

18:57.260 --> 18:58.270
We can order one to try.

18:58.290 --> 18:58.730
Okay.

19:01.590 --> 19:02.270
Here's your order.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.430
Please wait for a moment.

19:03.910 --> 19:04.390
Hello,

19:04.480 --> 19:05.870
I'd like

19:05.910 --> 19:06.790
one quinoa fig salad.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.070
And one...

19:09.110 --> 19:09.840
Wait a moment, let me take a look.

19:12.470 --> 19:13.070
Hello, Senior.

19:14.030 --> 19:14.500
You order.

19:14.860 --> 19:15.470
Thank you.

19:15.990 --> 19:16.550
Thank you.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.620
Why are you cutting in line?

19:22.830 --> 19:23.970
I’d like one classic salad.

19:24.070 --> 19:24.910
Childish.

19:25.050 --> 19:25.650
Wait a minute.

19:25.830 --> 19:26.280
Thank you.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.230
Senior Xiao,

19:34.250 --> 19:34.610
sit here.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.150
No need.

19:35.150 --> 19:35.750
It’s okay.

19:35.900 --> 19:36.690
Sit here.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.580
Senior Jiafa, sit here.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.650
It’s okay. Thank you.

19:39.670 --> 19:39.910
Have a seat.

19:39.950 --> 19:40.470
Thank you.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.470
Do you have to

19:43.470 --> 19:44.520
share a table with us?

19:44.870 --> 19:45.870
This is a public area.

19:54.950 --> 19:55.740
It’s so late.

19:55.790 --> 19:57.130
Why isn't the food served yet?

19:57.750 --> 19:59.290
Hello. Here's your salad.

19:59.770 --> 20:00.240
Thank you.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.130
Yuhe,

20:04.890 --> 20:06.090
don't you want to eat something spicy,

20:06.120 --> 20:07.240
and heavy?

20:07.630 --> 20:08.670
You ordered me a plate of green vegetables,

20:08.910 --> 20:10.040
even without a piece of meat?

20:10.230 --> 20:11.790
You have high blood fat, high blood pressure

20:11.790 --> 20:12.480
and high uric acid recently.

20:12.580 --> 20:13.220
Don’t eat meat.

20:13.450 --> 20:13.730
I...

20:16.670 --> 20:17.270
What a party!

20:18.030 --> 20:19.310
Meizi, you come today...

20:19.720 --> 20:20.330
Sit here.

20:20.570 --> 20:21.970
I’ll pack it up to see the counselor.

20:21.990 --> 20:22.710
Okay.

20:22.750 --> 20:23.470
Sit here.

20:23.910 --> 20:24.360
Bye bye.

20:26.930 --> 20:27.380
Chengcheng,

20:27.410 --> 20:28.580
you come here often, right?

20:28.610 --> 20:29.550
Yuhe and I chose for a long...

20:29.580 --> 20:30.270
Xiao Yuhe,

20:31.190 --> 20:32.530
you were going to the cafeteria, right?

20:32.710 --> 20:33.470
Don't you want to eat meat

20:33.470 --> 20:34.440
and spicy food?

20:34.670 --> 20:36.190
-This is a public area.
- Take it.

20:50.630 --> 20:51.270
By the way, Chengcheng,

20:51.550 --> 20:52.350
you’re following

20:52.350 --> 20:53.300
to do the mouse experiment now.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.050
Senior Xixi posted a paper

20:55.080 --> 20:56.320
on the repair

20:56.350 --> 20:57.000
of spinal cord injury in mice.

20:57.080 --> 20:57.830
I think it is particularly useful.

20:58.030 --> 20:58.750
You can read it.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.590
Which one?

21:01.940 --> 21:02.780
I even collected it today.

21:06.350 --> 21:06.950
This one.

21:15.550 --> 21:16.100
Gu Chen,

21:17.680 --> 21:18.840
there is some equipment in the lab

21:18.860 --> 21:19.450
that needs to be reimbursed.

21:19.860 --> 21:20.780
Take the invoices

21:21.120 --> 21:22.230
to find Dongmao.

21:23.830 --> 21:24.170
Okay.

21:25.710 --> 21:26.190
Chengcheng,

21:26.190 --> 21:26.830
I’m leaving now.

21:27.150 --> 21:28.110
I'll send you the paper on WeChat.

21:28.300 --> 21:28.700
Okay.

21:39.270 --> 21:40.270
He's been

21:40.270 --> 21:41.140
picking on me all day,

21:41.630 --> 21:42.990
Don't know what he's thinking now.

21:57.020 --> 21:57.510
Su Chengcheng,

21:58.110 --> 21:59.070
the data you gave me

21:59.070 --> 21:59.860
is too noisy.

22:00.190 --> 22:01.810
The signal-to-noise ratio is lower than 85 db.

22:01.950 --> 22:02.750
The electrodes must not

22:02.750 --> 22:03.860
have been implanted in the right place.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.160
Redo this data.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.760
This data can't be wrong.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.430
I’ve checked it many times.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.150
You may not have checked it correctly.

22:19.020 --> 22:19.780
I don't care about you.

22:31.380 --> 22:32.570
I've already switched to another group,

22:32.640 --> 22:33.680
but you're still tormenting me.

22:34.540 --> 22:35.710
You asked me

22:35.710 --> 22:36.830
to do EEG experiments on mice,

22:36.830 --> 22:37.350
and then you said

22:37.350 --> 22:38.630
the data from EEG experiments are not good,

22:38.630 --> 22:39.330
and asked me to do it again.

22:39.540 --> 22:40.580
I can’t do it.

22:40.910 --> 22:42.030
If you can, do it yourself!

22:44.230 --> 22:45.090
Senior Chengcheng,

22:46.090 --> 22:48.470
Yuhe asked you to do mice experiments?

22:51.260 --> 22:52.170
Actually Yuhe...

22:53.200 --> 22:54.120
In fact,

22:54.150 --> 22:55.230
I should not tell you this.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.440
But you are new here.

22:57.830 --> 22:58.760
Yuhe is afraid of mice.

23:02.100 --> 23:02.960
Really?

23:03.570 --> 23:04.520
He has high self-esteem,

23:04.750 --> 23:05.900
so we don't usually talk about it.

23:07.990 --> 23:09.270
He works in the lab.

23:09.270 --> 23:10.550
How can he be afraid of mice?

23:11.140 --> 23:11.730
There are all kinds of fishes...

23:11.790 --> 23:12.270
Well,

23:12.750 --> 23:13.300
all ordinary people

23:13.710 --> 23:14.970
have some shortcomings.

23:17.110 --> 23:18.200
Don't tell him that I told you that.

23:26.070 --> 23:26.720
Be afraid of mice.

23:28.630 --> 23:29.170
Speechless.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.070
Senior,

24:25.190 --> 24:26.880
I just thought about it.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.100
My attitude is not right.

24:29.450 --> 24:30.940
So I’m here to apologize to you.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.120
So

24:32.630 --> 24:33.110
can you

24:33.110 --> 24:34.350
show me how to do it?

24:34.510 --> 24:35.090
I promise

24:35.430 --> 24:36.390
I won't make the same mistake

24:36.390 --> 24:37.310
next time.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.340
Your apology...

24:51.310 --> 24:51.670
No need.

24:52.580 --> 24:53.210
You just do it.

24:54.070 --> 24:54.960
I'll check the quality of the data later.

24:54.990 --> 24:55.840
No, Senior,

24:56.180 --> 24:57.100
show it to me,

24:57.390 --> 24:58.450
then I can learn with you.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.030
No need.

25:03.830 --> 25:04.510
Senior,

25:07.150 --> 25:07.790
I'm really

25:07.990 --> 25:08.980
afraid of making mistakes

25:08.980 --> 25:10.270
in my experiments.

25:10.820 --> 25:12.290
Please show me once.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.070
Why are you hiding?

25:19.410 --> 25:21.030
Senior, why is your face white?

25:21.650 --> 25:22.980
Are you afraid of mice?

25:27.260 --> 25:28.600
How could I be afraid?

25:30.990 --> 25:32.160
I’ll just do it once.

25:52.950 --> 25:53.610
Take it.

26:06.670 --> 26:07.700
Let me open it for you.

26:08.130 --> 26:08.600
No need.

26:30.610 --> 26:31.440
Oh my God!

26:31.720 --> 26:32.810
Senior Xiao Yuhe

26:32.840 --> 26:36.100
has let the mice go.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.040
Why are you so loud?

26:48.720 --> 26:49.360
I heard that

26:49.390 --> 26:50.590
Yuhe let the mouse go.

26:50.700 --> 26:51.390
Yes.

26:51.390 --> 26:52.150
I saw that.

26:52.590 --> 26:53.430
Really?

26:53.910 --> 26:54.590
If Prof. Du knows that,

26:54.590 --> 26:55.430
he must be furious.

26:55.460 --> 26:55.930
Yes.

26:55.950 --> 26:56.960
He'll be furious.

26:59.830 --> 27:01.470
So many potato chips and drinks

27:01.490 --> 27:02.700
flavored with cilantro.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.650
Did Senior Xi buy them?

27:05.070 --> 27:05.530
I don't think so.

27:06.070 --> 27:07.030
I saw that Gu Chen

27:07.030 --> 27:08.180
brought a box of them when he came up today.

27:09.540 --> 27:09.970
Chengcheng,

27:10.510 --> 27:11.070
someone is here for you.

27:12.260 --> 27:13.050
Why didn't you answer the phone?

27:13.150 --> 27:13.730
Where's your phone?

27:16.830 --> 27:18.790
I have a big gossip

27:18.790 --> 27:19.440
to tell you.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.290
Hurry up! Let’s go.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.440
Chengcheng’s friend,

27:21.750 --> 27:22.680
there are no outsiders here.

27:22.830 --> 27:23.470
If it's convenient,

27:23.470 --> 27:24.940
let's gossip together.

27:25.710 --> 27:26.950
It seems a bit...

27:26.970 --> 27:28.430
It's not appropriate.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.040
Sit down.

27:30.070 --> 27:30.780
I'll sit down then.

27:33.870 --> 27:34.610
This matter

27:35.910 --> 27:36.840
has to start with you.

27:37.430 --> 27:38.510
Do you remember that

27:38.510 --> 27:39.110
the teacher who let you change the lab last time

27:39.140 --> 27:40.760
named Jiang Songrui?

27:41.870 --> 27:42.730
I now know that

27:42.910 --> 27:44.520
he is a superb person

27:44.540 --> 27:46.140
who loves to exploit students.

27:46.580 --> 27:47.470
Do you know

27:47.470 --> 27:48.120
the time clock for their lab?

27:48.960 --> 27:49.570
Do you know?

27:49.830 --> 27:51.280
007.

27:53.900 --> 27:54.730
Yes, 007.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.620
And he also loves to

27:56.650 --> 27:57.860
squeeze the student's allowance.

27:58.390 --> 27:59.270
Do you know how much money

27:59.270 --> 28:00.480
he pays for his doctors every month?

28:01.630 --> 28:02.270
Do you know?

28:02.410 --> 28:03.870
200 yuan.

28:08.750 --> 28:09.730
Yes, 200 yuan.

28:11.490 --> 28:12.640
So many doctors

28:12.680 --> 28:13.260
can't stand it anymore.

28:13.750 --> 28:14.430
They are in the sixth year of their doctorate.

28:14.670 --> 28:15.590
Their pressure is too much,

28:16.150 --> 28:17.510
so their hair falls out by the handful.

28:21.790 --> 28:22.610
Sorry, Senior,

28:22.640 --> 28:23.440
I didn't mean you.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.600
It doesn’t matter.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.670
So they're all posting together

28:27.670 --> 28:28.730
on the Internet now.

28:34.710 --> 28:35.640
Really?

28:36.120 --> 28:37.470
I met Prof. Jiang before,

28:37.500 --> 28:39.100
and he seemed kind,

28:39.450 --> 28:40.730
could he be such a person?

28:42.880 --> 28:43.810
You still don't believe me?

28:44.700 --> 28:45.170
See for yourself.

28:51.310 --> 28:52.730
Really?

28:52.760 --> 28:54.490
Don't doubt, that’s true.

28:54.630 --> 28:56.110
Fortunately, last time you didn’t transfer to his lab.

28:56.140 --> 28:57.500
Otherwise, as a small undergraduate,

28:57.910 --> 28:59.350
you'd be a sheep in a tiger's mouth,

28:59.380 --> 29:00.100
with no bones left.

29:00.270 --> 29:00.830
That's right.

29:00.850 --> 29:02.430
That's what Jiang Songrui is.

29:02.950 --> 29:03.870
When you told me that

29:03.870 --> 29:05.110
you were going to his lab,

29:05.110 --> 29:06.150
I didn't react.

29:06.220 --> 29:06.910
If I had,

29:06.930 --> 29:08.160
I wouldn't have let you go.

29:08.500 --> 29:08.830
Right?

29:09.270 --> 29:09.910
Later when Yuhe

29:09.910 --> 29:10.880
knew about it,

29:11.060 --> 29:12.250
so he immediately stopped you.

29:12.430 --> 29:12.900
But,

29:13.050 --> 29:14.130
you two got into a fight.

29:14.250 --> 29:14.890
So bad.

29:21.970 --> 29:22.490
Wait.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.410
You mean that

29:27.500 --> 29:29.270
Xiao Yuhe was helping me?

29:30.060 --> 29:31.180
Yes.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.780
If you don't believe,

29:33.870 --> 29:34.470
you can ask

29:34.490 --> 29:35.400
Yuhe and Zhao Yiran.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.080
They've both worked with Jiang Songrui,

29:37.110 --> 29:37.900
and they know him pretty well.

29:38.130 --> 29:38.800
Right, Yiran?

29:52.310 --> 29:52.670
Take it.

29:57.400 --> 29:57.970
Chengcheng’s friend,

29:58.270 --> 29:58.870
have some potato chips.

29:59.180 --> 29:59.710
No need.

29:59.910 --> 30:00.790
Senior, I’ll leave first.

30:00.790 --> 30:01.210
Okay.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.870
Share the gossip next time.

30:02.910 --> 30:03.450
Okay.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.430
Come and play often!

30:06.440 --> 30:07.000
Senior.

30:08.670 --> 30:09.510
Zhao Yiran!

30:18.150 --> 30:18.830
You heard

30:18.830 --> 30:19.600
what we just said, right?

30:28.270 --> 30:28.990
I've always

30:28.990 --> 30:29.990
thought of you as a good senior.

30:29.990 --> 30:30.740
Why did you do that?

30:32.180 --> 30:33.640
You...what do you mean?

30:34.390 --> 30:35.950
I saw you had no place to go,

30:35.950 --> 30:36.990
so I wanted to help you with good intentions.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.360
Besides,

30:39.220 --> 30:40.740
how could I know that Prof. Jiang

30:40.760 --> 30:41.680
has problems?

30:45.030 --> 30:45.710
Didn't you know that?

30:46.380 --> 30:46.640
I...

30:52.160 --> 30:52.980
That's it this time.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.540
Next time, you'd better not let me know.

30:55.110 --> 30:56.020
Otherwise I will...

30:57.400 --> 30:59.310
Otherwise, what can you do?

31:12.600 --> 31:13.640
Recently, Xixi seems

31:13.670 --> 31:15.260
to have participated in a boxing competition.

31:16.650 --> 31:18.080
She may need someone to practice with.

31:19.150 --> 31:20.120
You can go.

31:46.940 --> 31:48.390
I’ve gotten the reviewers' comments.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.510
Many of these comments are things

31:51.870 --> 31:53.950
I've already

31:53.950 --> 31:55.660
mentioned before!

31:57.190 --> 31:58.230
Have they all been corrected?

32:07.750 --> 32:08.120
Who?

32:11.610 --> 32:12.170
What sound?

32:17.630 --> 32:18.640
It sounds like

32:19.160 --> 32:20.820
a mouse eating potato chips.

32:21.990 --> 32:23.130
Who’s so bored?

32:23.160 --> 32:24.450
Have nothing to do?

32:24.810 --> 32:26.150
Then why did you feed the mouse chips?

32:26.430 --> 32:27.230
No one fed it that.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.400
So you mean that

32:32.140 --> 32:33.330
the mouse opened its cage

32:33.870 --> 32:34.830
after the experiment,

32:35.430 --> 32:37.400
and went to the supermarket and scanned a QR code

32:37.930 --> 32:38.760
to buy a packet of potato chips?

32:41.550 --> 32:42.950
Of course not, Prof. Du.

32:43.930 --> 32:44.480
Because...

32:53.230 --> 32:56.260
Catch it!

33:02.990 --> 33:04.400
I'm coming, I'm coming.

33:04.420 --> 33:04.860
Go.

33:09.630 --> 33:09.950
This side.

33:10.220 --> 33:11.140
There, there, there.

33:11.170 --> 33:11.810
Run that way!

33:11.840 --> 33:13.010
It's gone. It's gone.

33:26.050 --> 33:30.620
♫Like falling into the bottomless ocean♫

34:47.260 --> 34:48.530
It's in the...lab.

34:49.310 --> 34:50.070
I'm coming! I'm coming!

34:53.310 --> 34:54.429
I've got it!

35:01.980 --> 35:02.510
Great!

35:02.540 --> 35:03.660
I caught it myself.

35:03.910 --> 35:04.710
Little mouse.

35:05.780 --> 35:06.690
Am I good?

35:18.900 --> 35:19.390
Senior,

35:22.790 --> 35:23.710
you helped me

35:23.710 --> 35:24.710
by not letting me

35:24.710 --> 35:25.350
transfer to Prof. Jiang's lab?

35:25.370 --> 35:26.210
Don't think too much.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.230
I did it for a reason.

35:31.070 --> 35:32.260
Because you

35:32.260 --> 35:33.030
have participated in our lab's

35:33.030 --> 35:33.940
important projects,

35:34.390 --> 35:34.900
I'm afraid...

35:34.920 --> 35:36.930
You are afraid that I will disclose the content of the research,

35:37.270 --> 35:37.860
so

35:37.900 --> 35:39.120
you don't want me to go to another lab?

35:40.230 --> 35:40.590
Yes.

35:43.060 --> 35:44.180
That's a poor excuse.

35:47.190 --> 35:48.190
No button for coffee?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.060
I don’t drink!

36:09.910 --> 36:11.780
Senior Xixi, are you eating?

36:12.380 --> 36:12.980
Otherwise?

36:13.750 --> 36:14.100
Other...

36:17.250 --> 36:18.950
Other...otherwise,

36:19.300 --> 36:21.720
I'll go to get some more food.

36:44.770 --> 36:45.610
Senior Xixi,

36:47.550 --> 36:49.020
here is the juice I bought for you just now.

36:49.040 --> 36:49.580
Very tasty.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.560
It's mango flavor. Try it.

36:53.540 --> 36:54.150
What do you want?

36:55.980 --> 36:57.780
I want to say

36:57.980 --> 36:59.280
thank you for letting me stay.

36:59.660 --> 37:00.150
If it weren't for you,

37:00.150 --> 37:01.290
I'd have to leave.

37:01.950 --> 37:03.180
And if I had left,

37:03.360 --> 37:04.450
I would have regretted it now.

37:05.030 --> 37:05.810
I want to ask

37:06.070 --> 37:06.920
do you have time?

37:07.190 --> 37:07.590
If you have time,

37:07.590 --> 37:08.490
can I invite you to dinner?

37:10.720 --> 37:11.380
No need to thank me.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.220
I'm not the one

37:13.940 --> 37:14.460
who wants you to stay.

37:17.080 --> 37:17.640
Then who is it?

37:18.250 --> 37:19.070
Who do you think it is?

37:27.930 --> 37:29.410
With your brain,

37:30.100 --> 37:31.070
how did you

37:31.070 --> 37:32.000
get into our lab?

37:35.670 --> 37:37.340
In order to let you stay, Xiao Yuhe

37:37.460 --> 37:38.430
now owes me

37:38.430 --> 37:39.550
a set of mice facial recognition

37:39.550 --> 37:40.470
automatic feeding system.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.230
And he also promised to help Jiang Songrui

37:42.250 --> 37:43.150
to do the project together.

37:43.980 --> 37:46.090
Three labs a day,

37:46.430 --> 37:47.810
he really works hard for you.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.200
No way.

37:56.350 --> 37:57.800
How could he help me?

37:58.270 --> 37:58.990
I'm full.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.610
Ask him the rest yourself.

38:09.810 --> 38:10.690
Remind you,

38:11.230 --> 38:11.940
he is

38:11.980 --> 38:12.720
sometimes like this.

38:14.630 --> 38:16.670
What he says is

38:17.620 --> 38:18.700
the opposite of what he thinks.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.420
Did I misunderstand Xiao Yuhe?

38:27.550 --> 38:28.470
He doesn't

38:28.920 --> 38:30.610
seem as bad as I think.

38:33.590 --> 38:34.270
I'm getting more and more

38:34.270 --> 38:35.340
confused about him.
