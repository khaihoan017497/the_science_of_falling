[The Science of Falling in Love]

01:45.120 --> 01:47.720
[Episode 12]

01:54.470 --> 01:55.310
Take the lab rat,

01:56.190 --> 01:56.590
no,

01:57.520 --> 01:58.160
the roast chicken.

01:59.310 --> 02:01.750
Take the roast chicken and locate

02:02.130 --> 02:06.030
the midpoint of the front line of the upper spine as the center line.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.910
Five millimeters to the left of the center line,

02:09.509 --> 02:12.270
we bluntly separate the subcutaneous tissue...

02:12.300 --> 02:13.230
And paravertebral muscles.

02:13.270 --> 02:13.990
And paravertebral muscles.

02:14.790 --> 02:15.870
How about that?

02:15.950 --> 02:17.550
A whole morning of experiments on lab rats

02:17.690 --> 02:18.440
is not a waste of time, is it?

02:19.740 --> 02:20.280
Yes, it is.

02:21.210 --> 02:22.579
Can you say something I like to hear instead?

02:25.420 --> 02:26.220
Say,

02:26.600 --> 02:28.040
Gu Chen was doing great

02:28.070 --> 02:28.980
in his previous lab,

02:29.020 --> 02:29.870
why did he suddenly transfer

02:29.870 --> 02:30.720
to your lab?

02:32.100 --> 02:33.630
He said that he's more interested in

02:33.650 --> 02:34.410
Du Zhuanjia's research fields.

02:34.660 --> 02:35.470
It's but an excuse.

02:36.110 --> 02:37.590
Gu Chen's GPA is 4.9.

02:37.630 --> 02:38.600
He'll be accepted by any lab

02:38.630 --> 02:39.700
if he applies, right?

02:39.890 --> 02:40.310
Right.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.440
Moreover,

02:41.710 --> 02:43.110
if he's so interested in

02:43.110 --> 02:43.990
Prof. Du's experiments,

02:43.990 --> 02:44.990
why didn't he apply

02:44.990 --> 02:45.860
at the beginning?

02:45.950 --> 02:46.380
Am I right?

02:47.060 --> 02:47.350
Yes.

02:47.370 --> 02:47.890
Yes, you are.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.300
What do you mean?

02:53.870 --> 02:54.500
Say,

02:55.270 --> 02:55.770
is there any possibility that Gu Chen is

02:55.790 --> 02:56.630
into you?

02:57.630 --> 02:58.630
He knew that you are not happy

02:58.630 --> 02:59.350
working at Xiao Yuhe's place,

02:59.350 --> 02:59.960
so he discreetly and deliberately

02:59.990 --> 03:00.790
transferred here to lend you a hand.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.100
Be realistic.

03:02.270 --> 03:03.270
When I bought allergy medications

03:03.270 --> 03:03.910
and a jacket

03:03.910 --> 03:04.670
for Xiao Yuhe,

03:04.700 --> 03:05.910
it was Gu Chen who kept me company.

03:05.930 --> 03:07.220
He knows that I have a crush on Xiao Yuhe.

03:07.380 --> 03:08.810
Then that's even more telling.

03:09.370 --> 03:09.920
Previously,

03:09.950 --> 03:11.090
he knew that you have a crush on someone,

03:11.320 --> 03:12.000
so he cannot do much

03:12.030 --> 03:12.710
other than supporting you

03:12.750 --> 03:13.600
silently from behind.

03:13.730 --> 03:14.890
But now it's different.

03:14.950 --> 03:15.790
The situation has changed.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.360
Instead of supporting in silence,

03:17.390 --> 03:18.550
he decides to step in.

03:19.060 --> 03:19.410
In.

03:19.579 --> 03:20.030
In.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.079
Li Meizi,

03:21.540 --> 03:22.210
look at me.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.700
I'm all hurt and broken.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.900
Any teeny-weeny

03:24.920 --> 03:26.110
trivial stuff

03:26.140 --> 03:27.550
can be my last straw.

03:28.980 --> 03:29.620
Just let me be,

03:29.960 --> 03:30.410
please.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.520
Hurry up and eat.

03:31.550 --> 03:32.760
Then I'll head to the lab.

03:34.630 --> 03:37.150
They are a... a...

03:37.540 --> 03:39.060
a match made in heaven.

03:39.090 --> 03:40.600
OK, we've done messing around.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.390
Let's dig in.

03:53.430 --> 03:53.950
Look.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.810
The clubs are full of handsome boys.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.460
They are recruiting new members recently.

03:57.590 --> 03:58.540
We should drop by and have a look later.

04:01.270 --> 04:01.870
Hurry and eat.

04:15.300 --> 04:15.680
Hello,

04:15.710 --> 04:16.630
can I interest you in the Ping Pong Club?

04:16.649 --> 04:18.050
A hit on the ball, and you'll be the best of all.

04:18.860 --> 04:19.500
Hello,

04:19.700 --> 04:20.750
can I interest you in the Street Dance Club?

04:22.150 --> 04:23.590
I... I'll take a look at the Ping Pong Club.

04:24.710 --> 04:25.350
Then I'll take a look over there.

04:25.370 --> 04:25.860
Later.

04:31.990 --> 04:32.470
Chengcheng,

04:33.130 --> 04:34.280
you are interested in calligraphy?

04:36.210 --> 04:38.340
I... I'm just browsing around.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.060
You are also trying to join a club?

04:41.510 --> 04:42.340
Yes, I'm still choosing.

04:42.670 --> 04:43.270
Is there any possibility that Gu Chen's

04:43.270 --> 04:44.110
into you?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.280
He knew that you are not happy

04:45.310 --> 04:45.950
working at Xiao Yuhe's place,

04:45.990 --> 04:46.670
so he discreetly and deliberately

04:46.670 --> 04:47.530
transferred here to lend you a hand.

04:48.020 --> 04:48.710
Then I suppose you have already

04:48.750 --> 04:49.490
finished the physics assignment that's due tomorrow.

04:49.870 --> 04:50.630
Have you picked a topic?

04:51.700 --> 04:52.400
Not yet.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.230
It's due tomorrow.

04:55.070 --> 04:55.550
How about this.

04:55.710 --> 04:56.440
You hurry up and pick one today,

04:56.800 --> 04:57.760
and I'll ask the professor tomorrow

04:57.790 --> 04:58.550
to give our class one more day.

04:59.860 --> 05:00.670
Thank you, monitor.

05:01.180 --> 05:02.710
I'll go and find Meizi, then.

05:02.710 --> 05:03.350
OK.

05:43.110 --> 05:43.900
Are you alright?

05:45.620 --> 05:46.350
Thank you.

06:00.710 --> 06:01.300
Xixi.

06:01.850 --> 06:02.420
Xixi.

06:03.660 --> 06:04.640
Could you take a look at

06:04.670 --> 06:05.550
my design and see

06:05.550 --> 06:07.000
if there's something wrong with it?

06:12.230 --> 06:12.950
Your design is

06:12.990 --> 06:13.790
an experiment for long-term monitoring

06:13.790 --> 06:15.190
of lab rats' brain neuronal activity.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.900
Electrodes are implanted for up to one year.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.200
Now, you are using a

06:18.230 --> 06:19.360
Utah Electrode Array.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.910
It will cause immune responses

06:20.930 --> 06:21.860
when implanted for too long,

06:21.890 --> 06:22.590
which will lead to failure.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.910
In the end, the functioning time will only be a few months.

06:24.270 --> 06:25.070
You should change it into

06:25.070 --> 06:26.280
nano-mesh electrodes.

06:28.520 --> 06:28.890
OK.

06:29.340 --> 06:29.960
Thank you, Xixi.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.050
Wait, Xixi,

06:31.510 --> 06:32.550
do you have any time available in the next two days?

06:32.580 --> 06:33.260
I want to treat you to dinner.

06:33.310 --> 06:33.909
You have time for dinner,

06:33.909 --> 06:35.020
but you don't have time for your thesis?

06:38.570 --> 06:39.680
If you don't submit it tomorrow,

06:40.030 --> 06:40.820
you'll be doomed.

06:41.080 --> 06:41.850
I will. I will.

06:42.050 --> 06:42.890
Thank you, Xixi.

06:57.390 --> 06:57.790
Xixi,

07:00.340 --> 07:01.740
why are today's chips all coriander flavored?

07:02.690 --> 07:04.770
[Cilantro flavor]

07:03.550 --> 07:04.170
Who bought these?

07:04.800 --> 07:05.930
They were all purchased by Gu Chen.

07:07.670 --> 07:08.550
By Gu Chen?

07:13.930 --> 07:15.250
Xixi, Dongmao.

07:15.490 --> 07:16.010
Both of you are here.

07:45.909 --> 07:46.430
Gu Chen.

07:47.630 --> 07:48.540
Do you also like

07:48.570 --> 07:49.570
coriander flavored chips?

07:51.940 --> 07:52.590
Didn't you

07:52.610 --> 07:53.590
give me a bag of coriander flavored chips last time?

07:53.670 --> 07:54.710
I found it tasty.

07:54.990 --> 07:55.610
So I bought some more.

08:09.910 --> 08:10.500
Right, Xixi.

08:11.190 --> 08:11.710
How's your study

08:11.710 --> 08:12.430
on how to use steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)

08:12.430 --> 08:13.710
to locate retinopathy cells

08:13.710 --> 08:14.670
coming along?

08:15.540 --> 08:16.690
It's still processing.

08:17.190 --> 08:18.330
I'm going to study more about it

08:18.360 --> 08:19.200
tonight.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.210
This flavor tastes awful.

09:03.790 --> 09:04.230
Fortunately,

09:04.230 --> 09:05.020
I didn't pay for it myself.

09:05.700 --> 09:06.820
What tastes so awful?

09:07.870 --> 09:09.210
Coriander flavored chips.

09:10.190 --> 09:11.060
Coriander flavored?

09:11.390 --> 09:12.580
Why are you eating

09:12.580 --> 09:12.970
Zhang Xixi's stuff?

09:13.950 --> 09:14.470
It's not her purchase.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.390
Gu Chen bought it.

09:15.910 --> 09:16.940
There are plenty of these in the lounge.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.690
I can fetch one for you.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.470
No, I'm good.

09:19.100 --> 09:19.810
Here, try one.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.310
No.

09:25.430 --> 09:26.430
Who bought it?

09:27.670 --> 09:28.180
Gu Chen.

10:21.390 --> 10:22.250
This dog cafe

10:22.280 --> 10:23.300
is trending on social media.

10:23.330 --> 10:24.490
It's very difficult to book a table.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.120
But of course,

10:25.210 --> 10:26.380
all our consumption

10:26.400 --> 10:27.720
will be paid for by Ms. Li.

10:30.910 --> 10:32.340
Cheers.

10:38.090 --> 10:38.730
I want a snap too.

10:39.700 --> 10:40.700
I'm gonna post it on Moments.

10:44.750 --> 10:45.350
This is delicious.

10:46.170 --> 10:46.490
Too sweet.

10:47.910 --> 10:48.350
It's fine.

10:49.270 --> 10:49.830
Good grief.

10:49.830 --> 10:50.980
Did you check your Moments?

10:51.910 --> 10:53.100
Who did Gu Chen

10:53.120 --> 10:54.000
make the romantic gestures for?

10:54.030 --> 10:55.070
It's not something he normally would do.

10:55.400 --> 10:55.840
Take a look.

10:57.360 --> 10:57.890
Let me see.

10:57.910 --> 10:58.390
Here.

11:00.780 --> 11:03.410
"Dragons should hide in clouds."

11:03.550 --> 11:04.310
I know this one.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.370
It's from The Scenery under Moon by Shen Congwen.

11:06.580 --> 11:07.270
The next sentence is

11:07.460 --> 11:09.590
"You should hide in my heart."

11:10.330 --> 11:10.760
Gee.

11:10.790 --> 11:11.710
Gu Chen has a crush on someone.

11:11.710 --> 11:12.710
I should gossip about this.

11:13.050 --> 11:13.850
How come I can't see this?

11:14.240 --> 11:14.840
How come you can't...

11:14.870 --> 11:16.130
Gimme. Lemme see. Hurry.

11:18.270 --> 11:18.990
Why can't you see this post?

11:19.460 --> 11:20.090
Can you all see it?

11:20.810 --> 11:21.270
Yes, of course.

11:21.670 --> 11:22.300
We all can see it.

11:26.430 --> 11:27.160
Let me think.

11:30.820 --> 11:31.700
No way.

11:34.330 --> 11:35.570
You can't be the heroine

11:35.590 --> 11:37.180
Gu Chen's talking about.

11:38.350 --> 11:39.810
You are his crush.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.280
He's too shy about it,

11:41.300 --> 11:42.800
so he blocked you on this post.

11:43.150 --> 11:44.310
It's impossible.

11:44.310 --> 11:45.030
Maybe Gu Chen

11:45.050 --> 11:46.450
blocks me entirely.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.350
Lemme see.

11:48.420 --> 11:49.600
See for yourself.

11:49.770 --> 11:50.440
It's just this one post that's hidden from you.

11:50.790 --> 11:51.430
Right?

11:52.360 --> 11:52.990
What do you think?

11:53.480 --> 11:54.900
Does Gu Chen like Su Chengcheng?

11:55.670 --> 11:56.940
Good for you, Chengcheng.

11:57.620 --> 11:58.460
I heard that Gu Chen

11:58.480 --> 11:59.440
grew up in a wealthy family.

11:59.750 --> 12:00.510
He bought his own house

12:00.530 --> 12:01.660
when he was in high school.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.170
I also think Gu Chen is a decent choice.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.180
He's more suitable for you than Xiao Yuhe.

12:06.820 --> 12:07.260
See?

12:08.350 --> 12:10.050
Even Bro Ying, who's always silent in discussions,

12:10.070 --> 12:10.800
spoke up.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.150
What do you think?

12:15.110 --> 12:15.790
But,

12:17.220 --> 12:18.950
the person I have a crush on is not Gu Chen.

12:19.480 --> 12:19.990
What did you say?

12:22.390 --> 12:23.150
What did I say?

12:23.190 --> 12:24.230
I mean we are just

12:24.230 --> 12:24.950
good friends.

12:24.950 --> 12:26.430
I'm pretty sure he only sees me as a friend.

12:26.450 --> 12:27.480
Don't overthink this.

12:30.020 --> 12:30.700
Let's give this post a like.

13:06.470 --> 13:07.260
Don't you enjoy

13:07.260 --> 13:08.200
coriander flavored beverages?

13:10.910 --> 13:11.650
What are you trying to say?

13:14.630 --> 13:16.360
Since you are Su Chengcheng's friend,

13:16.970 --> 13:18.320
you should stay in the friend zone.

13:32.550 --> 13:33.010
Chengcheng,

13:33.140 --> 13:34.330
did you finish retrieving the equipment?

13:34.500 --> 13:35.470
When are you heading back to the dorm?

13:36.310 --> 13:37.920
Moreover, did Gu Chen contact you?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.330
I reckon he's going to

13:39.350 --> 13:40.470
confess his feelings to you in two days.

13:40.510 --> 13:41.940
You'd better prepare for that.

13:42.030 --> 13:42.430
Chengcheng.

13:44.950 --> 13:45.790
Let me help you.

13:45.910 --> 13:46.750
This is too heavy.

13:55.810 --> 13:56.890
Chengcheng, do you have a moment?

13:56.910 --> 13:57.660
I have something to tell you.

13:57.740 --> 13:59.060
I'm busy at the moment. I need to

13:59.080 --> 13:59.920
return the stuff to the laboratory.

13:59.950 --> 14:00.550
I'm all tied up.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.220
Well, then, what about tonight?

14:03.240 --> 14:03.950
The night's already taken, too.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.410
OK, it's alright.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.230
I'll tell you another day.

14:11.490 --> 14:12.750
Then it would be better if you tell me tonight.

14:14.040 --> 14:14.500
OK.

14:14.570 --> 14:16.270
Let's meet at the garden at nine.

14:19.540 --> 14:20.360
The garden?

14:40.110 --> 14:40.790
Why are you here?

14:43.220 --> 14:44.530
As soon as I saw you borrow the card from Zhang Li,

14:44.550 --> 14:45.420
I knew something was off.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.400
Now you even left the door unlocked.

14:47.790 --> 14:49.000
You are so confident about not being caught, aren't you?

14:49.320 --> 14:49.800
What's the matter?

14:50.420 --> 14:51.980
Du asked me to talk some sense into you.

14:54.150 --> 14:55.020
If that's the case, you can go back now.

14:57.510 --> 14:58.660
I figured that you wouldn't listen.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.480
If you did, then you wouldn't be Xiao Yuhe.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.550
Don't beat around the bush, get to the point.

15:06.930 --> 15:09.570
The development of Musk needs the knowledge of

15:10.660 --> 15:11.230
algorithm,

15:11.840 --> 15:12.700
psychology,

15:13.160 --> 15:13.800
mechanics,

15:14.480 --> 15:15.750
all those subjects.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.720
Even if you are a prodigy,

15:18.560 --> 15:19.470
don't you realize

15:19.830 --> 15:20.850
it would be

15:20.880 --> 15:21.770
too difficult to complete

15:22.060 --> 15:23.000
without any help?

15:25.020 --> 15:25.770
I already acknowledge all these problems

15:25.800 --> 15:26.330
you mentioned,

15:26.360 --> 15:27.600
and I can solve them.

15:29.030 --> 15:30.250
I've already fed Musk

15:30.270 --> 15:31.030
plenty of data.

15:31.180 --> 15:31.590
It's in the

15:31.590 --> 15:32.660
reinforcement learning stage.

15:32.910 --> 15:33.500
There's no need to worry.

15:33.710 --> 15:34.180
Everything's fine.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.560
You know for yourself that

15:36.210 --> 15:37.410
Musk needs a large amount of

15:37.430 --> 15:39.150
data on human emotional representations

15:39.180 --> 15:40.550
in order to accurately correspond to

15:40.570 --> 15:41.430
the mapping relationship of

15:41.460 --> 15:42.740
external appearances

15:42.770 --> 15:43.510
and internal emotional characteristics.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.230
Who's its current learning sample?

15:46.260 --> 15:47.220
Who does it interact with every day?

15:50.030 --> 15:51.490
It's only you, right?

16:03.750 --> 16:04.910
You set Musk

16:04.930 --> 16:05.900
as an

16:06.700 --> 16:08.560
emotional companion robot.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.610
But you yourself

16:12.780 --> 16:14.100
are a person with avoidant attachment style.

16:15.590 --> 16:17.590
Do you think you can train it well?

16:19.300 --> 16:20.340
I know I am

16:20.360 --> 16:21.430
a person with avoidant attachment style.

16:21.990 --> 16:22.660
It's hard for me to be aware

16:22.690 --> 16:23.680
of my true feelings,

16:24.140 --> 16:25.310
and it's even harder to directly express

16:25.330 --> 16:26.180
my feelings,

16:26.910 --> 16:27.950
which results in contrasting

16:27.970 --> 16:28.650
behaviors and thoughts.

16:28.870 --> 16:29.430
If someone

16:29.450 --> 16:30.340
makes me feel stressful,

16:30.650 --> 16:32.120
I'll instinctively choose to avoid them.

16:32.770 --> 16:34.200
This will indeed become

16:34.270 --> 16:35.400
the greatest obstacle of Musk's training.

16:36.690 --> 16:37.770
But I'll overcome it.

16:41.030 --> 16:41.630
Xiao Yuhe,

16:43.000 --> 16:43.700
you've changed.

16:46.510 --> 16:47.270
Did Du tell you

16:47.270 --> 16:48.280
about the lab?

16:49.230 --> 16:49.830
What's the matter?

16:55.020 --> 16:56.110
Our school hosts an assessment

16:56.110 --> 16:57.310
every three years.

16:57.920 --> 16:58.850
This year is when it takes place.

17:00.750 --> 17:01.800
Our lab

17:01.830 --> 17:02.350
has been doing basic research

17:02.380 --> 17:04.210
these recent years,

17:04.240 --> 17:05.510
and we haven't reached much of an achievement.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.020
So if we cannot

17:07.040 --> 17:08.020
pass the assessment this year,

17:09.790 --> 17:10.470
our lab

17:10.490 --> 17:11.270
might exist no more.

17:12.430 --> 17:13.690
What do you mean our lab might exist no more?

17:14.680 --> 17:15.530
It might get relegated,

17:15.790 --> 17:17.319
then split and merged with other labs.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.660
Du's been distressed lately,

17:20.950 --> 17:22.599
but he doesn't want us to feel pressured,

17:22.630 --> 17:24.220
so he said nothing about it.

17:26.020 --> 17:26.990
I know Musk

17:27.020 --> 17:28.460
means a lot to you.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.120
I'm not Du,

17:31.430 --> 17:32.790
I think it's perfectly fine

17:32.810 --> 17:34.240
for you to do what you want to do.

17:37.410 --> 17:39.200
But I also want you to know that

17:40.710 --> 17:43.540
you are a member of our lab.

17:44.460 --> 17:45.930
You must carry the responsibility

17:47.690 --> 17:48.890
assigned to you.

17:54.220 --> 17:54.950
I understand.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.230
You can head back now.

18:13.270 --> 18:13.870
Thank you.

18:21.020 --> 18:21.990
I'll lock the door for you.

18:37.790 --> 18:41.290
[Phase: Interaction module prototype completed]

18:37.790 --> 18:41.290
[Type: Emotional companion robot]

18:37.790 --> 18:41.290
[Musk Developed by: Xiao Yuhe]

18:41.810 --> 18:42.290
How about it?

18:42.460 --> 18:43.190
Am I right?

18:43.510 --> 18:44.310
Gu Chen and Xiao Yuhe

18:44.330 --> 18:45.060
both like you.

18:45.270 --> 18:45.830
What do you think?

18:46.270 --> 18:47.030
I don't know.

18:48.550 --> 18:49.390
Do you like Gu Chen?

18:49.510 --> 18:49.940
No.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.100
How about Xiao Yuhe?

18:54.610 --> 18:55.730
You still like him?

19:07.810 --> 19:08.860
At the beginning,

19:09.180 --> 19:10.380
I just thought he's handsome.

19:11.150 --> 19:11.950
Hotheadedly,

19:12.030 --> 19:12.960
I confessed my feelings to him.

19:14.630 --> 19:15.750
After the love experiment

19:15.780 --> 19:16.870
I felt exasperated.

19:17.470 --> 19:18.730
I made up my mind

19:19.090 --> 19:20.440
never to make a fool of myself again,

19:21.030 --> 19:21.860
and never to have anything to do

19:21.880 --> 19:22.680
with this person again.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.670
But then a lot of things happened,

19:28.380 --> 19:29.660
and I got to know

19:31.790 --> 19:32.570
a different aspect of him.

19:34.950 --> 19:35.740
Then I

19:36.350 --> 19:37.350
truly fell in love with him.

19:42.430 --> 19:44.340
He even treated me very well,

19:45.410 --> 19:46.230
which made me feel that

19:47.830 --> 19:48.560
maybe he,

19:50.230 --> 19:50.900
more or less,

19:51.830 --> 19:52.790
also has a little bit of

19:52.810 --> 19:53.720
a crush on me.

20:03.260 --> 20:04.690
It turned out that it's my own wishful thinking again.

20:08.670 --> 20:09.430
I was wrong again.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.820
He always makes me think

20:20.850 --> 20:22.850
that I'm a fool.

20:27.750 --> 20:28.910
He always makes me think

20:31.390 --> 20:32.260
that I'm not a person who's worth

20:32.300 --> 20:33.030
being loved.

20:36.630 --> 20:37.810
I hate to feel this way.

20:42.550 --> 20:43.230
You're wrong.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.820
Why do you always think for him?

20:46.570 --> 20:47.730
You cannot deny yourself

20:47.890 --> 20:49.040
just because of someone else.

20:49.060 --> 20:49.590
Right?

20:49.700 --> 20:50.990
No matter what Xiao Yuhe thinks,

20:51.290 --> 20:52.690
we all like you,

20:53.430 --> 20:54.410
and you are not a fool at all.

21:08.670 --> 21:09.220
There, there.

21:16.150 --> 21:16.660
Well,

21:17.550 --> 21:19.570
what about Gu Chen?

21:20.370 --> 21:21.370
You're gonna make it clear to him?

21:24.190 --> 21:25.190
I'll make it clear to him.

21:26.750 --> 21:27.070
OK.

21:50.870 --> 21:51.370
Chengcheng.

21:52.990 --> 21:53.470
Gu Chen.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.610
I bought you bubble tea.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.630
It's your favorite flavor.

21:56.660 --> 21:57.060
Thank you.

22:16.290 --> 22:17.440
Why don't you look at the screen?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.230
What's worth looking at?

22:41.970 --> 22:42.890
The drone. Where's the drone?

22:46.970 --> 22:47.850
Take a look, are these two

22:48.390 --> 22:49.510
Su Chengcheng and Gu Chen?

22:56.300 --> 22:57.420
I finally understand.

22:58.330 --> 22:59.970
I said a lot last time

23:00.520 --> 23:02.720
and nothing registered with you.

23:05.620 --> 23:06.380
Xiao Yuhe.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.570
It's not that I'm against you

23:10.170 --> 23:11.290
participating in the competition,

23:12.470 --> 23:13.310
I'm not a...

23:15.820 --> 23:17.440
ruthless person either.

23:18.660 --> 23:19.430
I also grew up...

23:22.910 --> 23:24.240
from your age.

23:25.110 --> 23:26.750
I understand the passion

23:26.780 --> 23:28.730
young people at your age possess

23:28.770 --> 23:29.680
when they want to do something.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.960
But it really

23:32.290 --> 23:33.820
is not the right time.

23:34.070 --> 23:34.750
What happened to you

23:34.950 --> 23:35.620
years ago

23:35.640 --> 23:37.350
was just barely suppressed,

23:37.870 --> 23:38.960
and you want to do it again.

23:39.730 --> 23:40.780
Aren't you deliberately

23:40.810 --> 23:42.320
putting yourself in danger?

23:43.310 --> 23:43.870
Right?

23:44.470 --> 23:44.920
Moreover,

23:46.970 --> 23:48.110
our laboratory is

23:48.340 --> 23:49.390
under great pressure as well.

23:50.710 --> 23:51.470
A lot of pairs of eyes

23:51.490 --> 23:52.320
are on us.

23:53.060 --> 23:53.820
Our research paper

23:54.030 --> 23:54.780
was rejected, again.

23:55.190 --> 23:56.320
If it continues this way,

23:56.870 --> 23:57.830
our laboratory's funding

23:58.140 --> 24:00.060
will be withdrawn entirely.

24:03.550 --> 24:04.880
Your phone just won't stop, right?

24:05.640 --> 24:06.600
It's been buzzing the entire time.

24:06.690 --> 24:07.490
Take a look at it.

24:14.060 --> 24:14.490
See.

24:14.630 --> 24:15.470
Are these two Chengcheng

24:15.490 --> 24:16.090
and Gu Chen?

24:16.480 --> 24:17.320
They are at the garden,

24:17.350 --> 24:18.830
talking and laughing all by themselves.

24:19.230 --> 24:20.470
Are you sure you are not going to take a look?

24:21.270 --> 24:22.240
You can leave. Just go.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.250
Please take good care of

24:23.280 --> 24:23.920
your own business.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.030
I see that

24:25.550 --> 24:26.470
our laboratory

24:26.500 --> 24:27.420
really can't count on you.

24:31.430 --> 24:31.950
Prof. Du,

24:32.310 --> 24:32.910
please do not worry,

24:33.780 --> 24:34.150
I'll put my heart

24:34.180 --> 24:35.130
in this project.

24:37.590 --> 24:38.960
But I have my own insistence.

24:48.930 --> 24:49.990
I asked you to come here today

24:50.060 --> 24:50.710
is mainly because of

24:50.710 --> 24:51.400
one thing I wanted to tell you.

24:55.030 --> 24:56.170
-I like Senior Xixi...
-I have a crush on someone else.

24:58.260 --> 24:58.820
What did you say?

25:03.610 --> 25:04.670
You like Senior Xixi?

25:06.830 --> 25:08.110
You know about how Senior Xixi is.

25:08.310 --> 25:08.880
She's not a person who likes

25:08.910 --> 25:09.830
to socialize,

25:10.230 --> 25:11.270
so it's even harder to chase after her.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.100
I've never told her,

25:13.800 --> 25:14.490
but

25:14.700 --> 25:15.290
you are in the same group

25:15.320 --> 25:16.160
as her,

25:16.910 --> 25:18.350
so, I want to...

25:22.110 --> 25:22.710
I got it.

25:23.850 --> 25:24.380
I got it.

25:24.960 --> 25:25.910
Thanks.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.060
Are you heading back to the dorm?

25:29.610 --> 25:30.490
I'm going to the library,

25:30.580 --> 25:31.390
I can give you a lift.

25:32.290 --> 25:32.900
I'm good.

25:33.220 --> 25:33.960
I'll wait here for...

25:34.550 --> 25:34.910
I mean,

25:35.080 --> 25:36.120
I have an appointment with someone.

25:36.150 --> 25:37.110
I have something else to do later.

25:37.150 --> 25:37.580
Well,

25:37.600 --> 25:38.400
I'll wait here a bit,

25:38.430 --> 25:39.130
you go ahead.

25:40.150 --> 25:41.100
OK, then bye.

25:42.090 --> 25:42.570
Gu Chen,

25:44.820 --> 25:45.590
why did you

25:45.590 --> 25:46.510
block me on Moments?

25:47.510 --> 25:48.150
Why did I block you?

25:48.640 --> 25:49.160
I didn't.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.150
You did.

25:53.610 --> 25:54.620
Tell me which post?

25:55.980 --> 25:57.500
The one with a quotation from Shen Congwen.

26:03.510 --> 26:04.090
Here's the thing.

26:04.550 --> 26:05.420
When I posted something on my Moments,

26:05.450 --> 26:06.690
my relatives always

26:06.720 --> 26:07.930
asked questions and it's annoying,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.130
so I moved them

26:09.160 --> 26:10.220
into a group and blocked them.

26:12.370 --> 26:14.200
M-My aunt's also named Su Chengcheng,

26:14.550 --> 26:16.010
and I might have made a mistake.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.270
Take a look. Take a look.

26:18.300 --> 26:18.870
It's true, see?

26:18.890 --> 26:19.960
My aunt really is named Su Chengcheng.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.180
My aunt's name is Su Chengcheng.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.900
Fine, you win.

26:22.930 --> 26:24.080
Hurry up and unblock me.

26:24.110 --> 26:24.950
I know. I know.

26:25.030 --> 26:25.390
OK.

26:25.410 --> 26:26.250
I'm removing you from the group right now.

26:27.330 --> 26:28.120
-Later, aunt.
-Off you go.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.150
-Go. Bye.
-I'm leaving.

26:30.270 --> 26:30.800
Bye. Bye.

26:30.950 --> 26:31.390
See you.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.390
I almost made a fool of myself again.

26:37.750 --> 26:38.200
That's a close call.

27:00.160 --> 27:00.870
Look.

27:04.420 --> 27:04.930
What a tragedy.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.180
Can you stop following me?

28:21.160 --> 28:22.040
I'll send you back.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.240
You're here to watch me make a fool of myself, right?

28:36.900 --> 28:37.580
Then you can watch it all you want.

28:39.570 --> 28:40.310
Are you happy?

28:45.280 --> 28:45.840
Dry yourself with this.

28:46.670 --> 28:47.350
Your hair's all wet.

28:51.710 --> 28:52.830
Who asked you to pity me?

28:54.260 --> 28:55.170
Who asked you to mind my business?

28:57.870 --> 28:58.870
Who asked you to be

28:58.890 --> 28:59.730
a hypocrite?

29:02.990 --> 29:03.860
Who asked you to transfer me

29:03.860 --> 29:04.680
to Senior Xixi's group?

29:05.070 --> 29:06.580
Who asked you to let me stay in the lab?

29:07.990 --> 29:09.080
Why are you being so unreasonable

29:09.110 --> 29:10.130
and annoying?

29:23.590 --> 29:25.020
I'm not wearing your clothes.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.160
It's...

29:31.920 --> 29:32.980
the one I bought for him.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.140
So he didn't throw it away.

29:37.260 --> 29:37.780
Put this on

29:38.570 --> 29:39.160
and hurry back.

29:39.910 --> 29:40.450
Don't catch a cold.

30:04.510 --> 30:05.130
Drink something warm.

30:07.920 --> 30:08.610
It's none of your business.

30:13.460 --> 30:13.940
Drink it.

30:18.960 --> 30:19.760
What are you gonna do this time?

30:20.270 --> 30:21.150
Drink my sorrows away.

30:47.070 --> 30:50.620
Cheers, my friend.

30:50.950 --> 30:55.560
Cheers, my friend.

30:55.590 --> 30:57.390
Bring up your glasses.

30:57.390 --> 30:59.100
Friends.

30:59.540 --> 31:00.950
Youth is brief.

31:01.210 --> 31:05.710
Let's have another bottle again.

31:21.870 --> 31:22.410
Su Chengcheng.

31:23.740 --> 31:24.520
The gate is over there.

31:25.220 --> 31:25.940
We should head back now.

31:30.510 --> 31:31.270
Where did I go?

31:31.760 --> 31:32.960
I'm at home.

31:34.690 --> 31:37.500
I'm at home and I'm gonna sleep.

31:45.880 --> 31:46.450
You're drunk.

31:47.000 --> 31:47.710
Let me take you back.

31:48.150 --> 31:48.710
Nope.

31:49.920 --> 31:50.670
If you don't head back now,

31:50.670 --> 31:51.750
the dorm's gonna close.

32:01.670 --> 32:02.470
Xiao Yuhe,

32:05.350 --> 32:06.300
do you know how much

32:06.330 --> 32:07.510
I've devoted to you?

32:12.930 --> 32:14.080
Because of you,

32:15.910 --> 32:16.990
I spent the money

32:17.150 --> 32:19.550
I had saved up for an electric bicycle.

32:21.930 --> 32:23.250
Do you know how hard it is

32:23.290 --> 32:24.080
for me to save up that amount of money?

32:25.920 --> 32:27.680
I saved for over six months.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.190
Do you know how many

32:31.190 --> 32:32.650
surveys I completed,

32:32.680 --> 32:34.340
and how many times I became the practice partner with someone

32:34.360 --> 32:37.880
to save up that small amount of money?

32:38.130 --> 32:39.460
Don't cry.

32:39.630 --> 32:41.140
Don't cry.

32:42.190 --> 32:45.890
Really, I worked so hard.

32:47.190 --> 32:50.040
I worked hard to buy you a piece of clothing,

32:50.070 --> 32:52.830
and you threw it away.

33:02.950 --> 33:03.720
What are you laughing about?

33:04.190 --> 33:04.960
Am I ridiculous?

33:05.240 --> 33:05.940
No.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.930
OK, you're drunk.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.180
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

33:09.890 --> 33:11.220
Don't say tomorrow to me.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.360
I don't want to hear it.

33:15.910 --> 33:16.900
Tomorrow I need to

33:16.950 --> 33:18.380
ride my bicycle.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.550
The chain of my bicycle

33:22.850 --> 33:24.570
always falls off.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.340
I have to place it back in place everyday.

33:29.460 --> 33:32.290
My hands are permeated with the smell of engine oil.

33:34.650 --> 33:36.710
Really. They still stink

33:36.710 --> 33:39.010
with engine oil.

33:39.270 --> 33:41.270
Have a sniff.

33:42.230 --> 33:42.670
Really.

33:42.700 --> 33:43.290
Don't cry.

33:43.550 --> 33:44.680
My hands smell like engine oil.

34:28.949 --> 34:29.889
OK, OK. Let's walk normally.

34:29.909 --> 34:30.440
Watch your step.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.340
I'm not gonna fall over.

34:32.429 --> 34:33.280
I'm good at walking.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.820
Watch me.

34:41.100 --> 34:42.000
Am I good at walking?

34:42.949 --> 34:44.560
Yes, not only walking,

34:44.670 --> 34:45.460
you are good at everything,

34:45.550 --> 34:46.030
OK?

34:47.360 --> 34:48.170
What am I good at?

34:49.120 --> 34:49.730
Why so sudden?

34:50.310 --> 34:51.110
What am I good at?

34:51.920 --> 34:52.719
Let me think.

34:53.739 --> 34:54.469
You

34:55.639 --> 34:57.690
have good skills in execution and action.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.760
I've learned how to catch lab rats.

35:02.790 --> 35:03.700
That's not what I mean.

35:04.530 --> 35:05.730
You are happy every day.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.370
You are always in a good mood, right?

35:09.090 --> 35:10.820
What else? Crying all day?

35:13.550 --> 35:14.060
How about this?

35:14.630 --> 35:15.260
Well,

35:17.680 --> 35:19.750
Jianming likes you,

35:19.940 --> 35:21.360
which means you are a good person.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.120
What's the point of Jianming liking me?

35:27.700 --> 35:28.740
You don't like me.

35:38.950 --> 35:39.860
Who says I don't like you?

35:54.550 --> 35:55.110
Let's go.

36:36.320 --> 36:36.780
We're here.

36:37.190 --> 36:37.950
You should hurry up and get upstairs.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.500
It's almost time for the curfew.

36:50.770 --> 36:51.630
What for?

36:53.310 --> 36:54.520
Why do I have to do

36:54.550 --> 36:55.200
whatever you said?

36:55.480 --> 36:56.570
Why do I have to listen to you?

36:57.750 --> 36:59.200
You are drunk. Get upstairs already.

37:00.460 --> 37:01.710
Lemme tell you something, Xiao Yuhe.

37:03.230 --> 37:04.710
Don't you think you can do whatever you like to me

37:04.730 --> 37:06.330
just because I have a crush on you.

37:06.510 --> 37:06.950
Listen,

37:06.950 --> 37:08.170
I was over you a long time ago,

37:08.310 --> 37:09.620
to tell you the truth.

37:11.410 --> 37:12.400
To me,

37:19.110 --> 37:19.800
you are like this.

37:21.670 --> 37:22.260
The air.

37:23.470 --> 37:24.310
Do you understand, the air?

37:31.150 --> 37:32.610
Like a bottle of air.

37:35.010 --> 37:35.980
That's enough.

37:36.270 --> 37:37.210
Are your roommates upstairs?

37:37.710 --> 37:38.760
How about asking them to pick you up?

37:39.660 --> 37:41.250
You don't believe me, do you?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.990
I'll prove it to you!

37:46.420 --> 37:46.910
See?

37:47.350 --> 37:48.380
Even if I'm this close to you,

37:48.410 --> 37:48.920
I'm...

38:00.630 --> 38:02.030
Am I blushing?

38:08.210 --> 38:09.900
There are many reasons to cause a blushing face.

38:10.420 --> 38:11.140
Blushing...

38:11.940 --> 38:12.910
Blushing...

38:13.830 --> 38:15.430
The causes of blushing

38:15.430 --> 38:16.390
are plenty.

38:17.510 --> 38:18.900
A person with high blood pressure

38:18.930 --> 38:21.980
will have an enlarged heart

38:22.550 --> 38:25.220
and increased myocardial contraction rate,

38:25.830 --> 38:26.770
causing...

38:27.830 --> 38:29.190
Blood vessels in the head to expand and become congested.

38:31.110 --> 38:31.450
Yes.

38:33.850 --> 38:34.160
Yes.

38:34.950 --> 38:36.240
Blood vessel dilation in the brain

38:36.790 --> 38:37.370
can also cause blushing.

38:38.280 --> 38:38.830
In addition,

38:40.550 --> 38:42.190
menopausal women

38:42.190 --> 38:44.430
also blush

38:44.450 --> 38:45.570
because of the decrease in estrogen.

38:45.910 --> 38:47.350
So it cannot prove that I have a crush on you.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.580
Let me try again.

38:54.350 --> 38:54.730
See?

38:54.750 --> 38:55.790
Even if I hug you like this,

38:55.820 --> 38:56.240
I also...

39:07.630 --> 39:08.710
My heart is racing.

39:15.830 --> 39:16.940
There are various causes

39:16.980 --> 39:17.810
of the acceleration of heart rate.

39:19.750 --> 39:20.960
Intense exercise,

39:21.470 --> 39:23.220
excessive mental stress,

39:23.960 --> 39:25.420
and hyperthyroidism

39:26.070 --> 39:27.360
can all result in heart racing.

39:27.860 --> 39:28.550
So it's not because

39:28.570 --> 39:29.320
I have a crush on you.

39:29.460 --> 39:30.240
Don't overthink it.

39:34.780 --> 39:35.270
You don't believe me?

39:53.660 --> 39:54.180
No,

39:54.900 --> 39:55.780
I can't do this.

40:13.620 --> 40:17.560
♫The wind passing by is listening♫

40:21.300 --> 40:25.580
♫The weather in summer is always changing♫
