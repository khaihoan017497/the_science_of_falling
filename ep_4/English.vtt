[The Science of Falling in Love]

01:45.170 --> 01:47.750
[Episode 4]

01:56.650 --> 01:57.920
Aunt, small steamed buns, please.

01:58.210 --> 01:59.000
Okay, wait a moment.

02:02.630 --> 02:04.250
Aunt, small steamed buns, please.

02:04.670 --> 02:05.540
You're late.

02:05.540 --> 02:06.500
The last small steamed buns

02:06.530 --> 02:07.960
have been sold out.

02:14.470 --> 02:14.970
Aunt,

02:15.250 --> 02:16.400
give him these small steamed buns.

02:16.490 --> 02:17.190
Pay by my card.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.250
I miscalculated last night.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.620
It should be 56.5 yuan.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.030
I overcharged you by 3.5 yuan.

02:26.329 --> 02:27.700
These small steamed buns are 5 yuan.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.510
1.5 yuan is my compensation to you.

02:29.530 --> 02:30.300
Never mind.

02:30.300 --> 02:30.829
It’s okay.

02:34.140 --> 02:35.250
Okay, thank you.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.350
He really took it.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.329
Have something else.

03:04.100 --> 03:04.590
Chengcheng,

03:05.510 --> 03:06.730
come and join us.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.320
Let's go to the lab after eating.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.990
No need, Senior Jiafa.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.720
I'm afraid if I sit there to eat,

03:11.740 --> 03:12.460
I'll choke.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.250
Yuhe,

03:20.310 --> 03:20.990
how did you get

03:21.010 --> 03:21.660
the small steamed bun?

03:21.660 --> 03:22.500
It's hard to buy.

03:23.940 --> 03:24.440
Have one.

03:24.610 --> 03:25.570
Okay.

03:33.250 --> 03:33.720
Delicious.

03:34.850 --> 03:35.410
Thank you.

03:38.020 --> 03:38.920
Chengcheng, did you buy this?

03:39.490 --> 03:40.460
You two are pretty close.

03:40.579 --> 03:41.340
Chengcheng, next time

03:41.340 --> 03:42.180
help me buy one cage, okay?

03:43.620 --> 03:44.050
What's wrong?

03:46.720 --> 03:47.480
Senior Jiafa,

03:48.590 --> 03:50.120
I won't go to the lab today.

03:50.190 --> 03:51.420
Please ask for a leave

03:51.420 --> 03:52.100
with Du Zhuanjia for me.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.340
Ask for a leave?

03:53.680 --> 03:54.329
How long?

03:54.570 --> 03:55.840
Until 2024.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.440
2024?

03:58.660 --> 03:59.250
Why?

03:59.930 --> 04:00.690
Because

04:00.710 --> 04:01.700
there is someone in our lab

04:01.700 --> 04:02.860
who is really annoying.

04:02.860 --> 04:03.890
I get annoyed when I see him.

04:04.470 --> 04:05.540
In 2024,

04:05.540 --> 04:06.960
he will graduate.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.100
After he graduates,

04:08.130 --> 04:09.000
I can go there.

04:10.860 --> 04:12.030
In 2024,

04:12.050 --> 04:13.480
someone will graduate, too.

04:14.930 --> 04:15.850
In 2024,

04:15.880 --> 04:17.779
if someone gets accepted to graduate school again,

04:18.209 --> 04:20.250
I'll be in school again.

04:20.850 --> 04:21.810
Zhu, eat more.

04:21.860 --> 04:22.820
Okay.

04:23.850 --> 04:24.740
I suggest you keep up with

04:24.740 --> 04:26.170
the college's requirements for postgraduate recommendation every year.

04:26.340 --> 04:27.740
Considering that

04:27.950 --> 04:28.830
less than 20% of biomedical engineering students

04:28.860 --> 04:29.860
have guaranteed postgraduate education

04:29.890 --> 04:30.580
in the past five years,

04:30.810 --> 04:32.790
and your current performance trend,

04:33.120 --> 04:33.940
your chances of getting postgraduate recommendation are so small

04:34.290 --> 04:35.210
that can be ignored.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.159
Eat more.

04:37.940 --> 04:38.380
Bye bye.

04:41.290 --> 04:42.640
How dare you humiliate me?

04:44.200 --> 04:44.970
He humiliated me.

04:46.030 --> 04:46.640
Eat more.

04:47.000 --> 04:47.970
The enemy is too strong.

04:49.250 --> 04:49.650
Eat.

04:58.830 --> 04:59.310
Jiafa,

05:00.310 --> 05:01.130
it's all this time,

05:01.260 --> 05:02.020
where's Chengcheng?

05:02.040 --> 05:02.710
She took a leave of absence.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.020
Leave?

05:04.840 --> 05:05.330
What's she doing?

05:05.730 --> 05:07.300
She said there is a very annoying person

05:07.300 --> 05:08.500
in our lab.

05:08.730 --> 05:10.200
She'll come back

05:10.820 --> 05:12.200
after that person graduates in 2024.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.270
You'll graduate in 2024, won't you?

05:14.730 --> 05:15.800
You're the one that Chengcheng hates?

05:16.080 --> 05:16.780
Go away.

05:17.130 --> 05:18.780
I'm very close to Chengcheng.

05:19.160 --> 05:19.740
Don't talk nonsense.

05:20.220 --> 05:20.790
Want some coffee?

05:20.930 --> 05:21.660
Yes, thank you.

05:31.040 --> 05:31.600
Yuhe,

05:32.860 --> 05:33.670
when will you graduate?

05:36.050 --> 05:36.500
Yuhe,

05:38.530 --> 05:39.550
the code keeps reporting errors.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.080
Why are there Chinese characters? Su Chengcheng?

05:48.920 --> 05:49.850
Why are you typing

05:49.850 --> 05:50.380
Chengcheng's name?

05:51.230 --> 05:53.340
I don't think she's serious.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.040
She hasn't come for so long.

05:55.380 --> 05:55.820
There's

05:56.620 --> 05:57.820
no one to clean the lab.

05:58.040 --> 05:58.450
Yes.

06:00.350 --> 06:02.140
Xiao Yuhe is right.

06:03.370 --> 06:04.260
You…You, sit down.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.060
Keep typing your code.

06:07.620 --> 06:08.970
Can any of you tell me

06:09.310 --> 06:10.420
why Su Chengcheng

06:10.420 --> 06:11.330
still hasn't appeared

06:11.360 --> 06:12.470
by this time?

06:13.780 --> 06:14.700
Prof…Prof. Du,

06:15.310 --> 06:15.570
I….

06:15.870 --> 06:16.870
She asked me to ask you for leave this morning.

06:16.900 --> 06:17.820
I forgot to tell you.

06:19.730 --> 06:20.800
Then there are two problems.

06:22.090 --> 06:22.900
First of all,

06:23.740 --> 06:25.120
you should eat more walnuts

06:25.700 --> 06:26.480
to replenish your brain,

06:27.180 --> 06:29.800
which is good for improving your memory.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.320
Second,

06:31.960 --> 06:32.830
about Su Chengcheng.

06:33.210 --> 06:34.580
How long does she have to ask for leave?

06:34.790 --> 06:35.510
Where is her written request for leave?

06:36.060 --> 06:36.830
What is the reason?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.090
Who approved it?

06:38.600 --> 06:40.409
I'm curious about these questions.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.360
I…I just

06:42.650 --> 06:43.840
passed it on for her.

06:44.430 --> 06:45.770
Well, you passed it on blindly.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.200
You can't pass it on without a note.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.490
You can only pass it on with a note.

06:51.150 --> 06:52.680
Don't keep saying yes.

06:53.170 --> 06:53.860
Stop it.

06:54.650 --> 06:56.150
Get in touch with her.

06:56.430 --> 06:57.080
Tell her that

06:57.320 --> 06:58.470
if she doesn't show up tomorrow,

06:58.590 --> 07:00.680
never come again.

07:00.740 --> 07:01.330
Okay.

07:01.740 --> 07:02.670
I have a meeting and I have to go.

07:03.070 --> 07:03.750
Goodbye, Prof. Du.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.640
Yuhe, use your phone

07:08.030 --> 07:08.820
to send her a message.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.770
I don't need to go to the lab.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.020
Why am I more unhappy than

07:26.040 --> 07:26.860
going to the lab?

07:34.730 --> 07:35.659
Prof. Du asks you

07:35.690 --> 07:37.090
to come to the lab tomorrow.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.890
Reply as soon as you see the message.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.600
Why doesn't she reply to me?

07:45.260 --> 07:47.080
It's her business to reply or not,

07:47.540 --> 07:48.570
and it's her business

07:48.810 --> 07:49.800
to graduate.

07:50.350 --> 07:51.340
I’d better send her another message.

08:00.290 --> 08:00.820
Yuhe,

08:02.810 --> 08:04.170
why did Chengcheng block you?

08:05.530 --> 08:10.930
[The message was sent, but was rejected.]

08:15.660 --> 08:17.390
Don't you have a cell phone?

08:17.750 --> 08:19.320
Must use my phone?

08:36.120 --> 08:36.990
I'm afraid you didn't have breakfast,

08:37.490 --> 08:38.450
so I went to Xueyuan Street

08:38.809 --> 08:39.990
and bought your favorite small wontons.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.419
I told the boss

08:42.020 --> 08:43.140
to add more cilantro and no scallions.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.260
Eat it now.

08:47.560 --> 08:47.950
Xixi,

08:48.850 --> 08:49.640
Xixi, don't be like this.

08:50.330 --> 08:50.820
I really have nothing to do

08:50.850 --> 08:51.540
with that girl.

08:52.150 --> 08:53.060
I just regard her as my junior sister.

08:53.090 --> 08:54.050
She misunderstood herself.

08:55.450 --> 08:56.410
I didn't expect her to pour milk tea on you.

08:56.780 --> 08:57.300
Xixi,

08:57.680 --> 08:59.180
are we going to break up

08:59.180 --> 09:00.000
because of this little thing?

09:01.380 --> 09:02.240
I apologize to you, okay?

09:02.560 --> 09:02.850
I...

09:04.340 --> 09:04.930
Don't touch me.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.590
Yes, I am sorry to you.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.320
I got too close to my junior

09:12.660 --> 09:13.960
But aren't you wrong about this?

09:14.580 --> 09:15.580
What's so great about you?

09:16.060 --> 09:17.020
Why do you always act like

09:17.060 --> 09:18.020
you're cold

09:18.020 --> 09:18.970
and superior?

09:19.850 --> 09:20.990
Did you ever value our relationship?

09:22.260 --> 09:23.560
Are you never sad?

09:24.180 --> 09:24.820
I’ve just

09:24.820 --> 09:25.500
eaten with her a few times

09:25.500 --> 09:26.260
and watched a few movies with her.

09:26.980 --> 09:27.790
It's all because

09:27.820 --> 09:28.620
you don't spend time with me.

09:28.830 --> 09:29.580
I didn't do anything wrong.

09:33.390 --> 09:34.140
Are you done?

09:35.530 --> 09:36.280
I was wrong.

09:36.890 --> 09:37.610
My biggest mistake is that

09:37.610 --> 09:38.450
I shouldn't be with you,

09:38.450 --> 09:39.490
a robot

09:39.490 --> 09:40.060
with no feelings.

09:54.710 --> 09:55.860
I told you

09:55.940 --> 09:57.190
not to spend too much money.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.270
I prepared it with care,

09:59.360 --> 10:00.340
and didn’t spend much money.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.820
My biggest mistake is that

10:01.820 --> 10:02.610
I shouldn't be with you,

10:02.610 --> 10:03.620
a robot

10:03.620 --> 10:04.210
with no feelings.

10:35.580 --> 10:36.380
Can you hurry up?

10:36.400 --> 10:37.120
I have to go to work.

10:37.300 --> 10:37.780
Sorry.

10:37.780 --> 10:39.020
I forgot my bus pass.

10:39.550 --> 10:40.740
You can use your cell phone.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.810
Cell phone, cell phone.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.670
Where's my cell phone?

11:10.130 --> 11:11.510
Cell phone.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.740
Have you seen my cell phone?

11:39.830 --> 11:41.320
I lost my phone.

11:45.340 --> 11:47.230
I lost my phone.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.420
Besides,

13:29.420 --> 13:32.090
she’s good at singing.

13:47.080 --> 13:47.760
Sorry to bother you.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.370
Where are you going?

13:52.300 --> 13:52.820
This is

13:52.820 --> 13:54.020
my rice with shredded pork and green pepper, right?

13:54.840 --> 13:56.150
Your sister is

13:56.170 --> 13:56.890
starving to death.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.380
It's really not enough for you.

14:01.430 --> 14:01.990
Li Meizi,

14:02.690 --> 14:04.030
after today,

14:04.380 --> 14:05.490
I understand a truth.

14:05.530 --> 14:06.100
What truth?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.870
It's good not to go to the lab for a while,

14:07.970 --> 14:09.440
and it will be always good not to go there.

14:09.590 --> 14:11.050
What was I thinking before?

14:11.500 --> 14:12.660
I got up early

14:12.660 --> 14:13.500
and go to the lab every day.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.660
I was crazy.

14:14.860 --> 14:16.120
What's wrong with your hair?

14:16.140 --> 14:17.180
Is it the standard for watching crosstalk?

14:18.780 --> 14:19.460
Oh no, I forgot.

14:19.460 --> 14:20.450
I'm dying my hair

14:21.740 --> 14:22.780
Tell me again.

14:22.780 --> 14:23.940
What color did you dye it?

14:25.290 --> 14:26.160
Dusty pink.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.350
It's not dusty pink,

14:28.480 --> 14:30.780
but dull Barbie pink.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.440
The color I bought is obviously dusty pink.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.300
Why did Taobao shopkeeper cheat me?

14:44.900 --> 14:45.500
What are you doing?

14:45.660 --> 14:46.580
Before anyone sees

14:46.580 --> 14:47.970
my big bright head,

14:47.990 --> 14:48.860
I'll buy hair dye cream

14:48.860 --> 14:49.620
to dye it back.

14:50.790 --> 14:51.740
Then you should pray that

14:51.740 --> 14:53.390
your hair dye cream will arrive soon.

14:53.420 --> 14:53.950
Otherwise

14:54.580 --> 14:55.340
your big head

14:55.580 --> 14:57.030
is destined to be seen.

14:58.380 --> 14:59.310
I’m socially dead.

15:07.290 --> 15:08.700
Whose little fairy

15:08.730 --> 15:10.270
just came out of the fairy castle?

15:12.970 --> 15:14.500
So beautiful.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.820
Just laugh at me.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.460
You've been found out.

15:36.420 --> 15:37.900
Enough.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.340
That's enough.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.970
I helped the counselor record the scores before.

15:42.990 --> 15:44.230
He just sent me the transcript.

15:44.820 --> 15:45.400
Do you want to see it?

15:45.970 --> 15:46.620
Do you want to see it?

15:53.890 --> 15:54.970
Amazing!

15:59.860 --> 16:00.350
Let me take a look.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.410
Then let me take a look.

16:05.970 --> 16:06.380
Here it is.

16:08.290 --> 16:08.850
I'm 30th.

16:09.550 --> 16:10.120
I'm 31th.

16:11.510 --> 16:13.270
We are sisters,

16:13.360 --> 16:14.510
heart to heart.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.010
Why are your grades so high?

16:21.490 --> 16:22.790
You two are really impressive.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.090
I’m not good.

16:25.290 --> 16:27.020
Ying and Gu Chen are really good.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.600
There's another thing you two should know.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.760
Just now, Xiaomeng and I went to the college building

16:33.790 --> 16:34.790
and heard the counselor say that

16:35.210 --> 16:36.380
the innovation credit

16:36.380 --> 16:37.580
is really important this time.

16:37.740 --> 16:38.590
So if you

16:38.620 --> 16:39.430
don't pass

16:39.460 --> 16:40.580
the final lab test,

16:40.940 --> 16:41.700
then you may

16:41.700 --> 16:43.620
have to publish a paper in a core journal

16:43.620 --> 16:44.540
to get your diploma.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.990
So come on, you two!

16:49.150 --> 16:50.120
Really?

16:50.550 --> 16:51.780
Why is it so strict?

16:52.930 --> 16:53.760
Yes.

16:53.930 --> 16:54.620
So we have to

16:54.620 --> 16:55.990
stay in the lab

16:56.060 --> 16:57.360
and take innovation credits.

17:02.900 --> 17:03.580
Why do I

17:03.580 --> 17:04.690
have a bad feeling about this?

17:09.550 --> 17:10.250
Did you hear that

17:11.030 --> 17:12.290
today's class is taught

17:12.740 --> 17:14.109
by our senior sister,

17:14.410 --> 17:15.170
Zhang Xixi.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.700
Zhang Xixi?

17:17.420 --> 17:18.210
I haven't heard of her.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.460
You haven’t heard of Zhang Xixi?

17:21.339 --> 17:22.430
She’s very famous.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.930
If she's willing to enter the competition,

17:25.480 --> 17:26.859
she'll be the prettiest in our school.

17:27.819 --> 17:29.160
She's so pretty,

17:30.270 --> 17:30.960
sweet

17:32.000 --> 17:32.540
and cool.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.850
I remember, it's her.

17:35.900 --> 17:36.440
Pretty, right?

17:37.360 --> 17:39.130
But she doesn't seem to be a good person.

17:39.630 --> 17:40.380
She’s a mistress.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.260
That man's girlfriend

17:41.260 --> 17:42.290
came to her

17:42.370 --> 17:43.300
and poured milk tea on her.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.910
Really?

17:46.210 --> 17:46.860
Is it online?

17:46.860 --> 17:47.460
Let me have a look.

18:01.050 --> 18:05.310
[Zhang Xixi]

18:08.350 --> 18:09.550
Hello, my name is Zhang Xixi.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.340
I'm a second year PhD student.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.140
I'm your senior sister.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.660
I will lead you

18:12.660 --> 18:13.380
to complete the physiology experiment class

18:13.380 --> 18:14.220
this semester.

18:14.330 --> 18:15.580
Today we are going to

18:15.610 --> 18:16.540
master

18:16.540 --> 18:17.820
the basic use of

18:17.820 --> 18:18.660
BL-410 biological signal processing system

18:18.660 --> 18:20.220
and the preparation of

18:20.220 --> 18:21.380
toad sciatic nerve gastrocnemius specimen.

18:21.450 --> 18:22.480
Are you clear?

18:32.880 --> 18:35.520
Okay, next, take a look at

18:35.540 --> 18:37.820
the experimental equipment on hand

18:37.850 --> 18:39.800
and the operation precautions.

18:39.940 --> 18:43.560
I'll hand out the toads.

18:55.530 --> 18:56.030
Don't be afraid.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.070
It won't hurt you.

18:59.380 --> 18:59.950
Boy,

19:05.990 --> 19:06.850
come and help.

19:12.380 --> 19:12.810
It’s okay.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.770
Senior Xixi is so cool.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.230
Goodbye, Senior Xixi.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.010
Bye, see you next week.

19:42.780 --> 19:43.370
Bye, Senior Xixi.

19:43.540 --> 19:43.950
Bye bye.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.320
Remember to review.

19:46.420 --> 19:46.820
Okay.

19:59.570 --> 20:00.880
Sister, I'm leaving too.

20:03.350 --> 20:05.620
Gu Cheng.

20:25.250 --> 20:25.730
Thank you.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.140
You're welcome. Actually, today I...

20:34.140 --> 20:34.700
See you next week.

21:35.540 --> 21:36.140
How about this?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.910
If the number of popcorn chicken left

21:39.160 --> 21:40.210
is even,

21:40.560 --> 21:41.320
I will go back.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.360
If it's odd,

21:42.450 --> 21:43.310
I won't go back.

21:46.460 --> 21:46.890
One,

21:47.620 --> 21:48.020
two,

21:48.780 --> 21:49.180
three,

21:49.820 --> 21:50.130
four,

21:51.180 --> 21:51.540
five.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.790
If this is an even number,

22:03.810 --> 22:04.760
I won't go back.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.070
If it's odd, I won't go back.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.370
All right.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.140
If you really don't want to go back,

22:09.140 --> 22:09.950
then don't go back.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.520
Don't worry about the paper,

22:11.540 --> 22:12.280
I'll take you to publish it.

22:12.870 --> 22:15.930
Ying, you're so kind to me.

22:25.770 --> 22:26.050
Drink it.

22:33.470 --> 22:34.380
I just thought about it.

22:37.610 --> 22:38.900
I'd better go back.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.340
It's hard enough for you

22:41.340 --> 22:42.620
to write your own paper.

22:42.620 --> 22:43.300
If you take me to write,

22:43.300 --> 22:44.500
I'll hold you back.

22:47.710 --> 22:49.590
My lab is a top lab.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.000
Many people

22:51.020 --> 22:51.900
can't even get in.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.890
What do I have to be dissatisfied with?

22:54.940 --> 22:55.780
If I can't,

22:55.980 --> 22:57.140
when I can't stay any longer,

22:57.490 --> 22:58.220
I'll come back to you.

22:58.220 --> 22:58.740
Then you take me.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.380
I'll go back tomorrow.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.450
I don't believe that

23:04.540 --> 23:05.260
there is a place

23:05.300 --> 23:06.060
where I can't stay.

23:06.220 --> 23:06.760
Sisters,

23:07.120 --> 23:07.770
let's eat!

23:09.120 --> 23:09.520
Okay.

23:15.670 --> 23:16.880
Oh no. What should I do with my hair?

23:19.010 --> 23:19.820
If I go back,

23:19.920 --> 23:22.050
Xiao Yuhe will laugh at me.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.680
No one. Safe. Let's go.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.350
Well,

24:35.610 --> 24:36.780
you just come to a laboratory,

24:36.810 --> 24:38.060
do you have to

24:38.080 --> 24:38.890
use me as a shield?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.040
Of course.

24:41.220 --> 24:42.180
If I run into the person

24:42.180 --> 24:43.170
I don't want to see,

24:43.200 --> 24:44.330
I'll be embarrassed.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.130
What's wrong?

24:59.310 --> 25:00.020
I tried my best.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.440
Are you going to be an actor?

25:40.120 --> 25:40.920
Come with me to the office.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.450
What do you mean?

26:00.940 --> 26:02.030
Who gave you the leave?

26:02.450 --> 26:03.720
Who granted you the leave?

26:04.370 --> 26:05.330
You come if you want to,

26:05.680 --> 26:06.860
and don’t come if you don't want to.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.820
You are disorganized and undisciplined!

26:10.780 --> 26:11.920
How can you do that?

26:12.940 --> 26:14.540
I've never had a student like you

26:15.570 --> 26:17.630
in all my teaching years.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.440
No, Prof. Du.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.110
I think I've dyed my hair bad.

26:23.130 --> 26:24.500
If I came to the lab,

26:24.720 --> 26:25.850
it would be a bad influence.

26:26.070 --> 26:27.310
So I didn't...

26:27.340 --> 26:28.250
So what?

26:28.520 --> 26:29.900
Are you having fun

26:29.900 --> 26:30.530
telling me this useless thing?

26:30.740 --> 26:31.790
You are a student.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.050
Why did you dye your hair?

26:34.120 --> 26:34.940
Hurry up and dye it back!

26:35.880 --> 26:36.280
Of course,

26:37.550 --> 26:38.590
I can't control you anymore.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.290
Soon,

26:40.050 --> 26:41.220
I will organize  students

26:41.250 --> 26:41.930
to vote for you.

26:42.370 --> 26:42.960
When the time comes,

26:43.140 --> 26:44.300
just go

26:44.370 --> 26:45.140
wherever you should go.

26:45.930 --> 26:46.380
I

26:47.850 --> 26:48.690
just tell you

26:48.720 --> 26:49.440
in advance today.

26:50.290 --> 26:50.660
You

26:51.790 --> 26:52.900
prepare yourself.

26:54.600 --> 26:55.040
Prof. Du...

26:55.070 --> 26:55.480
Besides,

26:58.960 --> 26:59.980
This is the assignment.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.150
There are seven questions in total.

27:02.180 --> 27:03.700
You got four wrong.

27:04.310 --> 27:05.310
I've told you before that

27:05.800 --> 27:07.510
I will never change my principles.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.000
No matter in class

27:10.190 --> 27:11.240
or in the lab,

27:11.760 --> 27:13.140
as long as you don't pass the exam,

27:13.690 --> 27:14.290
you won't

27:14.610 --> 27:15.330
pass with me.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.620
Take them all back and rewrite them.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.710
Submit it to me tomorrow morning.

27:27.050 --> 27:27.850
Take it!

27:46.740 --> 27:47.380
Xiao Yuhe?

27:48.770 --> 27:49.520
What are you doing?

27:50.780 --> 27:51.210
I...

27:52.210 --> 27:53.750
Do you believe me that I’m cleaning the window?

27:54.770 --> 27:56.270
Of course I believe what you say.

27:57.780 --> 27:58.480
Don't be angry.

28:20.780 --> 28:21.180
Xiao...

28:23.530 --> 28:24.030
Chengcheng,

28:24.410 --> 28:24.980
you've dyed your hair

28:24.980 --> 28:26.180
so brightly!

28:27.380 --> 28:28.070
You can really do whatever you want

28:28.100 --> 28:29.600
with a lot of hair.

28:33.830 --> 28:34.800
What's wrong, Chengcheng?

28:36.080 --> 28:36.770
Are you worried about anything?

28:39.250 --> 28:40.460
I probably can't

28:40.490 --> 28:41.630
stay in the lab anymore.

28:43.140 --> 28:43.900
Prof. Du said that

28:43.900 --> 28:45.100
he would let  students in the lab

28:45.100 --> 28:46.050
vote me out

28:46.080 --> 28:46.980
this week.

28:47.420 --> 28:48.830
He also said that I did a poor job in

28:48.860 --> 28:49.740
mold electricity,

28:50.320 --> 28:51.490
and asked me to rewrite it.

28:51.580 --> 28:52.640
But I really don't know how to do it.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.340
It's just mold electricity.

28:55.420 --> 28:55.930
After school,

28:55.930 --> 28:57.070
I'll help you make up for it.

28:58.290 --> 28:59.390
And about the voting,

28:59.990 --> 29:01.060
I’ll help you find a way.

29:02.820 --> 29:03.260
Not bad.

29:03.990 --> 29:05.280
The questions you got wrong are basic.

29:05.550 --> 29:06.490
If you really don't know how to do it,

29:06.730 --> 29:07.450
you can come to me.

29:09.470 --> 29:10.120
Thank you.

29:12.160 --> 29:12.820
No need.

29:15.740 --> 29:16.290
Yuhe,

29:16.600 --> 29:17.850
you'll definitely vote for Chengcheng, right?

29:23.870 --> 29:24.750
No need.

29:24.830 --> 29:25.710
I can't afford

29:25.740 --> 29:26.650
scholar-lord Xiao's vote.

29:30.380 --> 29:31.020
There are electrode caps in the lab

29:31.050 --> 29:32.390
that were used yesterday.

29:33.120 --> 29:33.940
You weren't here yesterday,

29:34.130 --> 29:34.730
so no one cleaned it up.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.380
Clean it up before you leave today.

29:45.780 --> 29:46.740
I have to finish the homework that

29:46.740 --> 29:48.130
assigned to me by Prof. Du today.

29:48.660 --> 29:49.500
Can I wash some first

29:49.500 --> 29:50.500
and the rest

29:50.520 --> 29:50.960
tomorrow?

29:53.930 --> 29:54.400
No.

30:03.900 --> 30:04.720
You scared me.

30:20.810 --> 30:22.690
Xiao Yuhe!

31:38.740 --> 31:39.380
Okay,

31:39.890 --> 31:41.390
you and Ying start first.

31:41.590 --> 31:42.720
I'll be right there.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.670
This bike looks familiar.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.940
You took me over speed bump.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.690
This wheel also took me, right?

32:13.570 --> 32:14.510
Aren’t you great...

32:21.650 --> 32:22.960
Why is it stuck?

32:30.940 --> 32:31.860
This damn bike.

32:31.860 --> 32:32.970
Why is it bullying

32:32.970 --> 32:33.880
like its owner?

32:48.070 --> 32:48.810
Do you need help?

32:51.620 --> 32:52.380
Not yet.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.380
I can do it myself.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.440
It was your car that hit me.

32:55.460 --> 32:56.340
I have nothing to do with it.

33:17.290 --> 33:17.940
Are you okay?

33:22.210 --> 33:22.930
Do you care about me?

33:23.010 --> 33:23.910
I'm talking about the bike.

33:27.560 --> 33:28.960
I knew you wouldn't be so kind.

33:41.950 --> 33:43.230
Good night, Senior Xiao.

33:45.450 --> 33:46.620
Watch out for the chains.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.050
Yes, yes, yes!

34:00.070 --> 34:01.050
I finally finished correcting the questions!

34:01.280 --> 34:01.910
Thank you, Ying.

34:04.270 --> 34:05.480
Are you done?

34:06.310 --> 34:08.060
I’m just writing the second question.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.739
I still have so many more.

34:09.770 --> 34:11.239
What should I do?

34:11.260 --> 34:13.460
I can't finish it.

34:13.659 --> 34:14.350
Bro,

34:14.380 --> 34:16.330
I've been here since 6:00, okay?

34:16.370 --> 34:17.290
It's your fault for not coming earlier.

34:20.719 --> 34:21.780
Xiao Yuhe.

34:26.620 --> 34:27.219
All right, all right.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.389
Don't hold it in. Don't hold it in.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.380
Has Xiao Yuhe offended you again?

34:30.530 --> 34:31.900
He never stops.

34:36.300 --> 34:36.800
Then...

34:38.290 --> 34:39.280
Sorry.

34:40.290 --> 34:42.520
Then let's go?

34:43.940 --> 34:44.690
Let's go.

34:45.260 --> 34:46.230
Time is running out.

34:48.100 --> 34:48.960
Sorry.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.300
I'm so miserable.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.460
What's going on here?

36:10.820 --> 36:11.900
Don't come to class

36:11.900 --> 36:12.990
at the right time in the future.

36:14.010 --> 36:14.850
After you come at the right time,

36:14.850 --> 36:15.770
you’ll have to adjust.

36:16.170 --> 36:17.130
After you adjust,

36:17.420 --> 36:18.770
I'll have already finished two key points.

36:19.820 --> 36:20.550
What can you listen to then?

36:26.610 --> 36:27.500
It's almost time.

36:27.840 --> 36:28.800
Let's start the class.

36:29.370 --> 36:30.470
From now on,

36:31.030 --> 36:31.970
everyone who enters the classroom

36:31.990 --> 36:32.910
is late.

36:33.280 --> 36:33.720
Deduct the usual...

36:33.740 --> 36:34.270
Prof....

36:38.580 --> 36:39.310
Are you boxing?

36:40.850 --> 36:41.780
Su Chengcheng, you're late.

36:41.810 --> 36:42.580
No, Prof..

36:42.580 --> 36:43.460
There are still a few seconds left.

36:46.420 --> 36:46.830
Look.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.080
Before the class,

37:02.330 --> 37:04.520
let's talk about this assignment!

37:05.990 --> 37:06.990
I’ve taught you

37:07.840 --> 37:09.240
all the contents

37:09.270 --> 37:10.190
in class before.

37:11.010 --> 37:12.190
When the questions diverge,

37:12.740 --> 37:13.830
mistakes abound.

37:15.460 --> 37:16.210
You still didn't

37:16.210 --> 37:16.820
pay attention in class.

37:17.020 --> 37:19.110
This is the foundation of the foundation!

37:19.140 --> 37:19.740
Everyone,

37:19.840 --> 37:20.950
if you can't master them,

37:21.570 --> 37:23.070
how can you enter the practical stage?

37:24.690 --> 37:27.290
Add a mock test after class today.

37:27.820 --> 37:28.960
Record it in the usual score.

38:02.340 --> 38:02.930
Prof. Du.

38:04.030 --> 38:04.870
Have you done the module?

38:06.020 --> 38:06.660
Yes.

38:06.780 --> 38:08.180
I'm waiting for you to come to the lab this afternoon

38:08.180 --> 38:08.840
to show you.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.060
Good.

38:10.740 --> 38:12.060
I have a quiz

38:12.060 --> 38:12.860
for my undergraduates later.

38:13.020 --> 38:13.980
Come to invigilate the exam if you are free.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.290
I... I...

38:17.620 --> 38:17.980
I...

38:18.020 --> 38:19.140
I think I have a small bug

38:19.140 --> 38:20.290
that I need to fix.

38:20.320 --> 38:20.620
Prof. Du,

38:20.620 --> 38:21.950
can you find someone else?

38:22.450 --> 38:23.490
What's wrong with you?

38:23.650 --> 38:24.760
Such a simple little task.

38:24.780 --> 38:25.420
When it comes to you,

38:25.930 --> 38:26.910
there are bugs...

38:27.540 --> 38:28.300
At your level,

38:28.320 --> 38:29.070
how can you graduate?

38:29.090 --> 38:29.830
No, I...

38:29.940 --> 38:30.900
Have it your way.

38:31.090 --> 38:31.900
Or just find someone

38:31.900 --> 38:32.440
to invigilate the exam for you.

38:41.410 --> 38:41.960
Dongmao,

38:43.050 --> 38:43.860
are you busy later?

38:45.100 --> 38:47.700
I still have a bunch of models that

38:47.700 --> 38:49.010
haven't been adjusted with Yuhe.

38:49.150 --> 38:49.570
Well,

38:51.060 --> 38:51.660
I can’t.

39:00.020 --> 39:00.750
Li.

39:04.020 --> 39:04.710
Senior Jiafa,

39:04.740 --> 39:06.920
I have a sudden attack of gastroenteritis.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.330
I need to go to the toilet first.

39:12.860 --> 39:13.440
Too fake.

39:14.490 --> 39:15.730
The toilet is over there.

39:20.020 --> 39:20.850
I'm done with mine.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.360
Why don't I go for you?

39:22.550 --> 39:22.950
Really?

39:23.500 --> 39:24.140
Which class?

39:25.670 --> 39:26.590
Biomedical engineering class 2.

39:29.370 --> 39:30.760
Isn't that Su Chengcheng's class?

39:33.870 --> 39:34.280
Xiao,

39:34.800 --> 39:36.800
you're not going, are you?

40:08.210 --> 40:09.270
Put your books away now.

40:09.670 --> 40:10.870
Let's start the exam.

40:13.220 --> 40:14.300
Have a good exam.
