[The Science of Falling in Love]

01:45.229 --> 01:47.729
[Episode 3]

02:05.450 --> 02:06.250
Perfect.

02:12.570 --> 02:13.190
It looks good.

02:13.210 --> 02:13.760
That’s it.

02:15.540 --> 02:18.180
I'm not very comfortable wearing this.

02:18.210 --> 02:20.650
I'd better change it.

02:21.880 --> 02:22.890
No.

02:23.300 --> 02:23.980
You would be wrong

02:24.150 --> 02:25.520
to think so.

02:25.660 --> 02:26.340
An important occasion

02:26.340 --> 02:27.360
like an amusement park

02:27.390 --> 02:28.500
calls for

02:28.500 --> 02:29.660
such a delicate dress.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.190
Don't run around.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.730
This makes you appear quiet and sweet.

02:34.510 --> 02:35.040
Furthermore,

02:35.290 --> 02:36.210
due to its small size,

02:36.240 --> 02:37.300
you have to

02:37.329 --> 02:38.300
eat very little.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.690
This will help you lose weight

02:39.690 --> 02:40.930
and will make him think

02:40.930 --> 02:41.660
you are a fairy

02:41.750 --> 02:44.130
who eats like a bird.

02:44.190 --> 02:44.610
How is it?

02:44.820 --> 02:45.660
Isn’t it good?

02:46.700 --> 02:47.780
What you said

02:47.780 --> 02:49.210
seems to

02:49.230 --> 02:51.090
make sense.

02:51.370 --> 02:52.430
Of course.

02:58.660 --> 02:59.820
Your hands.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.700
No, it’s not comfortable.

03:01.730 --> 03:02.370
I shouldn't be

03:02.370 --> 03:03.210
wearing your dress.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.090
It's not comfortable at all.

03:04.090 --> 03:04.860
Take a breath.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.480
Cheng, you are so lucky.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.050
I didn't expect that

03:24.170 --> 03:25.670
it would happen to me.

03:26.650 --> 03:27.850
With a straight A student.

03:30.850 --> 03:33.130
I am leaving.

03:34.130 --> 03:34.590
Go.

03:41.170 --> 03:41.700
Senior.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.640
Have you been waiting long?

03:45.360 --> 03:46.740
Just a while. Come on.

03:55.000 --> 03:55.579
Su Chengcheng.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.250
I will definitely surprise you

03:57.650 --> 03:58.780
on this date.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.470
I feel like I'm stepping on a cloud right now,

04:13.260 --> 04:14.730
and everything is light.

04:15.750 --> 04:16.519
Is this

04:17.399 --> 04:18.810
what it feels like to be in love?

05:04.270 --> 05:04.820
Senior.

05:05.180 --> 05:05.860
I accidentally

05:05.860 --> 05:07.000
stained your coat.

05:07.020 --> 05:07.730
Sorry.

05:08.580 --> 05:09.190
It’s for you.

05:13.770 --> 05:14.190
No need.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.230
I will wash it after coming back.

05:15.810 --> 05:16.230
Let’s go.

[Tomb Raider Ghost Town]

05:37.750 --> 05:38.390
Senior.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.159
Could we

05:39.180 --> 05:40.140
change a project?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.930
I've been terrified of this since I was little.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.020
I don't want to go in.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.230
Have you heard of the drawbridge effect?

05:46.210 --> 05:46.930
Yes.

05:47.290 --> 05:48.730
When a person is in danger,

05:49.310 --> 05:50.780
his heart beats faster

05:51.140 --> 05:51.930
and he will be short of breath involuntarily.

05:52.260 --> 05:52.909
This reaction

05:52.940 --> 05:54.300
is the same as throbbing.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.280
According to the Two-Factor Theory of Emotions,

05:56.810 --> 05:58.020
people mistake this feeling

05:58.020 --> 05:58.920
for throbbing.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.400
So the more you are afraid,

06:01.740 --> 06:03.140
the easier it is to  promote our relationships.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.130
When you go back for an MRI,

06:05.510 --> 06:06.500
the effect will be more pronounced.

Let’s go back.

06:58.140 --> 06:59.920

08:02.260 --> 08:04.020
They are all coming over.

08:09.650 --> 08:11.970
Help!

08:36.190 --> 08:37.360
Where did you go?

08:37.390 --> 08:38.539
I was terrified

08:38.580 --> 08:39.590
to be alone in the back.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.539
Why were you walking so fast?

08:46.100 --> 08:47.150
How about you hold my hand?

08:47.520 --> 08:49.300
It would be safer.

08:51.480 --> 08:51.930
Okay.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.580
Do you ever get the feeling that

09:03.350 --> 09:04.710
the two of us have met before?

09:06.350 --> 09:06.890
Before?

09:07.010 --> 09:07.900
How long ago?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.390
When I was in freshman year?

09:09.900 --> 09:10.580
A long time ago.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.320
I don’t think so.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.370
If I ever met you,

09:17.540 --> 09:18.680
I would definitely remember you.

09:34.890 --> 09:35.530
Let’s go ahead.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.950
Game over.

09:56.220 --> 09:56.760
Senior.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.310
I really don’t want to go on.

10:01.340 --> 10:02.290
I’m a little tired.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.880
Shall we go back first?

10:04.640 --> 10:05.710
I bought joint tickets.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.060
We can't go back

10:07.420 --> 10:07.880
until the test is done.

11:54.870 --> 11:56.050
Half for you and half for me.

Take this and you will be

If I see you,

12:03.820 --> 12:05.160
I will recognize you.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.540
Senior, what are you doing?

12:12.540 --> 12:13.530
We are a team.

Did you mean it?

13:54.420 --> 13:55.020
Su Chengcheng.

14:19.310 --> 14:19.720
Nothing.

14:20.770 --> 14:21.460
Let's go back to the lab

14:21.480 --> 14:22.180
and test the data.

14:39.190 --> 14:40.670
Electronics, metal objects

14:40.770 --> 14:41.210
and magnetic cards

14:41.470 --> 14:42.230
are not allowed inside.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.080
They can affect the uniformity of the magnetic field,

14:44.660 --> 14:45.580
cause image disturbances,

14:45.690 --> 14:46.320
and form artifacts.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.100
They may also damage the machine.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.250
The magnetic field strength of this machine

14:51.250 --> 14:52.080
is 3.0 Tesla,

14:52.660 --> 14:53.300
and its market price

14:53.320 --> 14:54.300
is more than 15 million.

14:54.700 --> 14:55.470
Be careful.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.680
The underwire on the underwear isn’t allowed either.

15:25.450 --> 15:26.770
I have a few questions for you.

15:29.860 --> 15:30.820
Why did you hit me on purpose

15:30.820 --> 15:31.820
during the shootout?

15:34.770 --> 15:35.810
You also deliberately tricked me

15:35.810 --> 15:36.940
in the haunted house, right?

15:39.230 --> 15:39.660
Turn around.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.010
Did you arrange everything

15:45.220 --> 15:46.430
in the amusement park today?

15:50.900 --> 15:51.970
You wanted to make a fool of me on purpose,

15:51.970 --> 15:52.610
didn't you?

16:04.690 --> 16:05.660
You don’t like me.

16:11.590 --> 16:12.230

Recall carefully

16:36.390 --> 16:37.140
what happened today

16:37.140 --> 16:38.550
in your mind,

16:39.070 --> 16:40.930
and let the brain neurons be activated again,

16:41.280 --> 16:42.850
so as to observe the data changes.

16:52.630 --> 16:54.630
Help!

16:55.010 --> 16:55.720
Let’s go ahead.

17:01.050 --> 17:02.240
Did you mean it?

18:06.200 --> 18:06.900
You like me?

18:08.660 --> 18:10.360
When you like someone,

18:11.090 --> 18:12.170
the ventral tegmental area and caudate nucleus area

18:12.170 --> 18:13.950
of the midbrain area

18:14.280 --> 18:15.000
will be activated,

18:15.290 --> 18:16.180
and the blood oxygen concentration

18:16.220 --> 18:17.480
near the two areas will increase significantly,

18:18.940 --> 18:19.660
which will be clearly displayed

18:19.660 --> 18:20.650
on the image.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.080
But nothing happens

18:22.480 --> 18:23.270
to your image.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.290
My mood

18:36.290 --> 18:37.480
was greatly disturbed just now.

18:37.980 --> 18:38.820
So I think

18:38.820 --> 18:40.300
the test result is inaccurate.

18:49.530 --> 18:50.270
I don't understand

18:50.300 --> 18:50.940
why you insist on me

18:50.970 --> 18:52.360
proving that I like you.

18:53.460 --> 18:54.220
Isn't love

18:54.260 --> 18:55.190
a subjective feeling?

18:55.690 --> 18:57.450
I am the subject of this matter.

18:57.730 --> 18:58.610
Only I have the right

18:58.610 --> 18:59.340
to say whether

18:59.870 --> 19:00.980
I like you or not.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.340
Human beings are creatures

19:02.340 --> 19:04.260
that are easily deceived by their own subjectivity.

19:05.600 --> 19:06.610
Fear and throbbing

19:06.610 --> 19:08.250
are the same in physical expression.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.220
It is only from different interpretation perspectives

19:10.220 --> 19:11.510
that there are different interpretations.

19:15.630 --> 19:16.680
Human feelings are not reliable.

19:18.220 --> 19:18.900
And the experimental results

19:18.900 --> 19:19.720
have proved that

19:20.800 --> 19:21.710
you don't like me at all.

19:25.830 --> 19:26.770
Why are you playing tricks on me

19:26.770 --> 19:27.570
all day?

19:28.700 --> 19:29.460
If you don't like me,

19:29.460 --> 19:30.900
just reject me.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.300
Why did you ask me

19:32.300 --> 19:32.980
to come to the lab

19:32.980 --> 19:33.930
for the experiment?

19:33.930 --> 19:35.220
Am I your guinea pig?

19:48.080 --> 19:49.680
It's okay if you think so.

19:52.140 --> 19:52.940
The main focus of this lab

19:52.940 --> 19:54.250
is human emotion.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.400
Didn't you say you like me?

19:58.570 --> 19:58.990
This is just enough

19:59.580 --> 20:00.860
to meet all the data

20:00.860 --> 20:02.200
we need for this experiment.

20:15.170 --> 20:15.650
Okay.

20:52.700 --> 20:53.370
It turns out that

20:54.740 --> 20:56.280
people cannot step on clouds.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.120
The moment the water vapor dissipates,

21:00.080 --> 21:01.670
one will fall from the high altitude of fantasy

21:02.730 --> 21:04.150
to the cold ground

Did you go to the bathhouse instead?

21:35.060 --> 21:35.660

21:36.430 --> 21:37.470
What happened to you?

21:39.320 --> 21:40.410
I was fooled.

21:40.950 --> 21:41.670
Fooled?

21:48.540 --> 21:49.690
He didn't want to

21:49.690 --> 21:50.940
be with me at all.

21:53.890 --> 21:55.200
The date

21:55.570 --> 21:56.580
and amusement park

21:57.410 --> 21:58.410
were designed to trick me

21:58.440 --> 21:59.450
into experimenting.

22:02.510 --> 22:03.810
I’m just a guinea pig,

22:04.730 --> 22:06.740
a living tool man.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.740
What?

22:08.940 --> 22:10.050
Xiao Yuhe

22:10.050 --> 22:11.150
went too far.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.300
You have been so unlucky lately.

22:13.850 --> 22:14.940
You’d better

22:14.940 --> 22:15.380
step over the brazier

22:15.380 --> 22:16.060
to get rid of bad luck.

22:16.060 --> 22:16.680
I’m going for it.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.180
Save it. Sit down.

22:22.010 --> 22:22.670
Cheng.

22:23.190 --> 22:23.820
I still find this

22:24.150 --> 22:25.470
a bit odd.

22:25.660 --> 22:26.380
There are so many people

22:26.380 --> 22:27.620
in our school who like him.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.410
Why did he ask you to be his tool man?

22:29.890 --> 22:30.720
How would I know?

22:31.940 --> 22:33.690
Maybe it's our horoscopes that don't match.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.490
Do I look

22:39.490 --> 22:40.640
particularly deceitful?

22:42.920 --> 22:43.680
Kind of.

22:46.780 --> 22:47.740
My head hurts now

22:47.740 --> 22:48.860
just thinking of

22:48.860 --> 22:50.100
Xiao Yuhe's name.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.080
Cheng.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.730
You don't know Xiao Yuhe well.

22:54.010 --> 22:54.900
Take it as if

22:54.900 --> 22:56.350
you have seen his true colors clearly this time.

22:56.650 --> 22:57.280
It’s good.

23:13.260 --> 23:13.910
Musk.

23:14.350 --> 23:15.350
Recognize my emotions.

23:16.380 --> 23:17.570
Scanning starts.

23:21.010 --> 23:21.620
Age.

23:21.870 --> 23:22.740
Twenty-one years old.

23:23.100 --> 23:23.730
Gender.

23:23.940 --> 23:24.500
Male.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.920
The emotions identified

23:26.330 --> 23:26.870
are concern

23:27.210 --> 23:27.770
and sadness.

23:29.550 --> 23:30.430
Are you broken?

23:31.120 --> 23:32.440
How could I be in this mood?

23:33.480 --> 23:35.270
Because you habitually

23:35.300 --> 23:36.950
deny your fragility

23:37.540 --> 23:38.300
and cannot be aware of

23:38.350 --> 23:40.110
your care and sadness,

23:40.510 --> 23:42.690
you can't realize

23:42.780 --> 23:44.300
your true feelings at all.

23:44.300 --> 23:45.100
No way.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.330
Don't I know

23:46.360 --> 23:47.240
how I feel?

23:50.210 --> 23:50.860
Then tell me

23:50.860 --> 23:51.650
why I am sad.

23:53.090 --> 23:53.840
I have no idea.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.190
But I know

23:55.360 --> 23:56.300
it's a good choice

23:56.320 --> 23:58.140
to eat your favorite food

23:58.360 --> 24:00.060
when you're sad.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.250
It’s for you.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.170
I know a way to

24:08.170 --> 24:09.020
make french fries super tasty.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.250
Take a try.

24:15.950 --> 24:16.810
You have to dip the fries

24:16.810 --> 24:17.950
in the ice cream

24:17.980 --> 24:19.880
while they are freshly made and hot.

24:24.940 --> 24:25.380
How is it?

24:25.420 --> 24:26.040
Does it taste good?

24:26.600 --> 24:27.700
I didn't lie to you, did I?

24:28.420 --> 24:29.660
I eat this every time

24:29.660 --> 24:30.070
I'm unhappy.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.220
I'm happy after eating it.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.220
This is something I invented myself.

24:33.220 --> 24:33.860
I'm too smart.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.150
I admire myself so much.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.540
Would you like to see anything?

24:41.130 --> 24:41.600
What?

24:52.340 --> 24:53.330
What’s this?

24:54.330 --> 24:54.990
A robot.

24:58.450 --> 24:59.850
I've seen it in the cartoon.

24:59.980 --> 25:00.660
It is powerful

25:00.660 --> 25:01.420
and can fight.

25:01.910 --> 25:03.230
But this one is different

25:03.250 --> 25:03.900
from the one in the cartoon.

25:04.230 --> 25:04.910
It doesn’t fight,

25:05.580 --> 25:07.100
but is a companion robot.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.870
It can analyze human emotions

25:09.610 --> 25:10.760
and communicate like a human.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.060
I will definitely make it

25:12.380 --> 25:13.400
when I grow up.

25:13.900 --> 25:14.750
Make it?

25:15.080 --> 25:16.050
The cartoon says that

25:16.130 --> 25:17.260
robots are hard to make.

25:17.710 --> 25:18.780
Why would you make it in the future?

25:20.190 --> 25:22.210
Because I have been

25:22.930 --> 25:24.200
playing alone all the time.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.090
It is my good friend I drew.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.760
At that time I thought

25:30.950 --> 25:31.910
it would be better

25:32.030 --> 25:33.400
if it wasn't on paper.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.250
If it becomes true,

25:35.920 --> 25:36.760
it can accompany me

25:37.590 --> 25:38.550
and more people.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.130
So cool.

25:40.260 --> 25:41.170
It's your friend,

25:41.200 --> 25:42.410
and it's also mine, right?

25:43.130 --> 25:44.620
May I draw one too?

25:44.890 --> 25:45.580
Of course.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.250
Sorry.

25:52.670 --> 25:54.310
My mom won't let me use my left hand.

25:54.350 --> 25:54.970
Never mind.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.400
Just use your left hand.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.340
That’s it.

26:04.370 --> 26:05.590
I'll be your mirror.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.680
Forget it.

27:14.340 --> 27:15.120
I figured it out.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.020
So soon?

27:20.030 --> 27:20.580
Women

27:21.160 --> 27:22.500
don't have to waste their emotions

27:22.500 --> 27:23.370
on this kind of man.

27:24.650 --> 27:25.820
In order to repay

27:25.820 --> 27:26.480
your love for me,

27:26.840 --> 27:27.780
I decided to

27:27.780 --> 27:28.590
be liberal of my money

27:28.680 --> 27:29.780
and treat you to McDonald's today.

27:30.700 --> 27:31.320
Tell me

27:31.680 --> 27:32.320
what you want to eat.

27:33.390 --> 27:33.920
I'm going to

27:34.400 --> 27:35.280
change my hairstyle,

27:35.590 --> 27:36.230
get changed

27:37.440 --> 27:38.410
and go on a date with you.

27:41.640 --> 27:42.530
So soon.

27:42.730 --> 27:43.280
Women

27:44.330 --> 27:45.020
are all fickle.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.500
Cheng, why didn’t you

27:48.500 --> 27:49.410
order takeout?

27:49.530 --> 27:50.920
But asked us out at night?

27:51.710 --> 27:53.090
You don’t understand.

27:53.450 --> 27:54.660
McDonald's delivery fee

27:54.660 --> 27:55.330
is nine yuan,

27:55.330 --> 27:56.920
and you can't order cones.

27:57.010 --> 27:57.400
Right.

27:59.970 --> 28:00.720
Let’s go.

28:04.700 --> 28:05.450
Are you in a bad mood?

28:07.280 --> 28:07.640
No.

28:08.300 --> 28:10.450
Stop pretending in front of me.

28:10.740 --> 28:11.970
Every time you're in a bad mood,

28:11.970 --> 28:13.250
you eat chips with ice cream.

28:13.580 --> 28:14.820
What a strange habit.

28:16.660 --> 28:17.700
Is it so delicious?

28:28.260 --> 28:29.050
How was your experiment

28:29.080 --> 28:29.570
with Cheng?

28:32.620 --> 28:33.980
Why do you have to let her

28:33.980 --> 28:34.830
experiment with you

28:35.160 --> 28:36.470
and prove that she doesn't like you?

28:38.380 --> 28:39.680
Because what she said is unbelievable.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.290
The experiment also verified this conclusion.

28:44.550 --> 28:45.750
So what are you going to do next?

28:51.770 --> 28:52.770
Hello, your cone is ready.

28:52.830 --> 28:53.700
Okay, thanks.

28:53.730 --> 28:54.140
You are welcome.

28:55.230 --> 28:55.650
Take your time.

28:56.710 --> 28:57.320
Let’s go.

28:58.860 --> 28:59.450
Let’s go.

29:08.550 --> 29:09.370
Excuse me.

29:09.490 --> 29:10.230
Let me clean it up.

29:12.270 --> 29:13.000
Sorry, aunt.

29:25.450 --> 29:25.930
Wait.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.050
Obviously he didn’t watch out

29:29.720 --> 29:31.080
and hit me.

29:31.750 --> 29:32.620
Why should I leave?

29:36.410 --> 29:36.900
Su Chengcheng.

29:36.900 --> 29:37.870
What are you going to do?

29:38.320 --> 29:39.300
What are you going to do?

29:39.970 --> 29:40.530
Senior Xiao.

29:42.020 --> 29:42.790
Why are you back?

29:44.550 --> 29:46.040
I just thought about it carefully.

29:46.380 --> 29:47.170
Judging from the trajectory

29:47.170 --> 29:48.500
of the two of us colliding,

29:48.860 --> 29:49.770
it was you who hit me.

29:49.930 --> 29:51.170
But I am generous.

29:51.460 --> 29:53.050
I decided to share the loss with you.

29:53.940 --> 29:55.730
Just now we bought four cones,

29:55.860 --> 29:56.680
two large fries,

29:56.780 --> 29:57.820
eight spicy chicken wings

29:57.850 --> 29:59.020
and three chicken nuggets.

29:59.190 --> 29:59.570
And...

30:00.500 --> 30:01.140
What else?

30:01.420 --> 30:02.100
Two pineapple pies.

30:02.140 --> 30:02.990
Two pineapple pies.

30:03.170 --> 30:04.730
A total of 121 yuan.

30:06.270 --> 30:07.110
You only need to

30:07.720 --> 30:08.650
give me 60 yuan.

30:19.220 --> 30:19.790
Thank you.

30:20.750 --> 30:21.850
Let’s go.

30:27.180 --> 30:28.330
Hello, your order is ready.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.590
There are four cones left, please hold on.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.120
Okay.

30:43.060 --> 30:43.580
Hello.

30:43.660 --> 30:44.060
Hello.

30:44.090 --> 30:45.100
I want a copy of

30:45.100 --> 30:45.740
what the girl ordered just now.

30:45.740 --> 30:46.170
Let me check.

30:46.170 --> 30:46.720
Hold on.

30:47.050 --> 30:47.940
She ordered four cones,

30:47.940 --> 30:48.540
two large fries,

30:48.590 --> 30:49.380
eight spicy chicken wings

30:49.420 --> 30:50.710
three chicken nuggets and two pineapple pies.

30:50.730 --> 30:51.420
Please confirm.

30:52.530 --> 30:52.980
No problem.

30:53.070 --> 30:53.750
Okay, wait a minute.

30:59.920 --> 31:00.840
Okay, your meal is ready.

31:01.060 --> 31:01.490
Thank you.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.390
You are welcome.

31:07.090 --> 31:07.930
For Cheng?

31:13.420 --> 31:14.170
For Jiafa.

31:16.340 --> 31:16.740
Wait.

31:18.140 --> 31:18.860
Jiafa can’t eat

31:18.890 --> 31:19.680
four cones.

31:20.710 --> 31:21.280
Man.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.300
Add more chilli, sir.

31:23.320 --> 31:23.720
Okay.

31:23.740 --> 31:24.510
No cilantro.

31:24.710 --> 31:25.310
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

31:28.980 --> 31:29.490
Cheng.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.530
I think Xiao Yuhe is nice.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.090
Today you asked him to transfer the money,

31:35.120 --> 31:35.710
and he did

31:35.740 --> 31:36.580
without saying a word.

31:36.940 --> 31:37.660
Exactly.

31:37.740 --> 31:38.380
I also don't think

31:38.380 --> 31:39.570
he is as bad as you say.

31:39.570 --> 31:40.100
Right.

31:40.210 --> 31:41.340
But

31:41.340 --> 31:42.370
it was his mistake.

31:43.130 --> 31:44.090
Ying is right.

31:44.780 --> 31:45.540
You two,

31:45.540 --> 31:46.930
don't be fooled by his appearance.

31:46.930 --> 31:47.860
That's camouflage.

31:50.580 --> 31:51.070
Hold on.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.900
Sixteen yuan for four cones.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.200
Twenty-two yuan for two large fries.

31:56.950 --> 31:58.040
Fifty-six point five.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.090
Three point five.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.770
I overcharged him 3.5 yuan.

32:05.660 --> 32:06.490
No way!

32:07.000 --> 32:08.420
I overcharged him 3.5 yuan.

32:08.420 --> 32:08.900
Will he think that

32:08.900 --> 32:09.700
I deliberately asked him

32:09.700 --> 32:10.970
for 3.5 yuan more?

32:11.420 --> 32:11.910
Maybe.

32:12.170 --> 32:12.670
Perhaps.

32:14.260 --> 32:14.860
What to do?

32:14.890 --> 32:15.960
How about I transfer the money to him now?

32:16.950 --> 32:18.490
It’s been so long.

32:18.640 --> 32:19.710
It would be awkward.

32:19.920 --> 32:20.750
I agree.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.020
It’s originally a request for justice.

32:26.050 --> 32:27.380
Why did it become like this?

32:28.610 --> 32:29.700
Why did it become like this?

32:30.380 --> 32:30.890
Musk.

32:32.240 --> 32:32.890
I don’t understand.

32:36.130 --> 32:37.400
I played a trick on her

32:37.490 --> 32:38.610
in the shootout and the haunted house.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.170
I also bumped on the speed bump

32:41.200 --> 32:42.580
while riding an electric car.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.140
I thought it would relieve my anger.

32:46.140 --> 32:46.570
But

32:49.730 --> 32:50.510
when I think that

32:50.530 --> 32:51.580
she can't recognize me,

32:51.580 --> 32:53.210
and even forget Zhu Panpan,

32:54.650 --> 32:55.570
I feel upset.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.090
But seeing her unhappy

33:01.490 --> 33:02.590
makes me feel uncomfortable.

33:05.080 --> 33:05.940
Sorry.

33:06.420 --> 33:08.250
I don't know how to comfort you

33:08.820 --> 33:11.290
because I have no idea of

33:11.390 --> 33:12.880
what happened to you back then.

33:17.930 --> 33:18.670
Think about it.

33:19.350 --> 33:21.140
Would you like to go abroad with me?

33:22.370 --> 33:23.760
I have decided to stay here.

33:24.100 --> 33:24.800
When we were kids,

33:25.040 --> 33:26.640
we always cared about promises.

33:27.100 --> 33:28.420
But I soon discovered that...

33:28.910 --> 33:29.610
I am leaving.

33:29.710 --> 33:32.150
promises are actually made to be broken.

33:32.870 --> 33:34.330
Even the closest people

33:35.190 --> 33:36.640
will abandon you by surprise.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.010
Since then,

33:38.580 --> 33:39.920
I have borne the weight

33:39.940 --> 33:41.030
of my mother's life alone,

33:41.740 --> 33:43.100
and I was so overwhelmed that I couldn't breathe.

33:43.670 --> 33:45.470
I built a high wall in my heart

33:45.990 --> 33:47.540
to keep everyone out,

33:47.980 --> 33:49.950
leaving only myself in my world.

33:50.230 --> 33:51.430
I made a life plan

33:51.830 --> 33:53.340
and pressed the accelerator button for myself.

33:53.850 --> 33:55.330
In this way, I became a weirdo

33:55.360 --> 33:56.870
in the eyes of my peers.

33:57.250 --> 33:58.770
No one could enter my world,

33:59.250 --> 34:00.120
and I didn't need them.

34:00.890 --> 34:01.670
Professor.

34:01.710 --> 34:03.510
Not everyone likes to make friends.

34:03.570 --> 34:05.280
If he doesn't like to talk, he doesn't have to.

34:05.730 --> 34:06.980
Until I met Su Chengcheng.

34:07.590 --> 34:08.449
Don't you understand yet?

34:08.760 --> 34:11.489
She opened a window in my high wall.

34:13.650 --> 34:14.850
What’s  this?

34:15.040 --> 34:15.960
Take a look and you’ll know.

34:16.739 --> 34:17.610
So many...

34:20.860 --> 34:23.719
One, two, seven, eight,

34:24.370 --> 34:24.860
sixteen.

34:25.650 --> 34:26.929
Really sixteen.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.170
Where did you buy it?

34:29.190 --> 34:30.360
I also want one set.

34:30.980 --> 34:31.780
I have no idea.

34:32.949 --> 34:34.659
It was a gift from my dad

34:35.159 --> 34:36.380
when I was a kid.

34:37.510 --> 34:38.949
You must like it very much.

34:39.139 --> 34:40.280
What a cool gift.

34:41.909 --> 34:43.190
I give you

34:43.219 --> 34:43.850
the most precious gift.

34:45.219 --> 34:46.980
Take this and you're

34:46.980 --> 34:47.820
my best friend.

34:48.260 --> 34:48.750
And I

34:49.420 --> 34:50.750
used all my courage

34:51.639 --> 34:53.860
to make an agreement with her to be good friends for a lifetime.

34:55.900 --> 34:56.800
I even

34:57.300 --> 34:59.220
changed my life plan for her.

35:10.340 --> 35:11.080
But maybe

35:11.700 --> 35:13.620
we all have the courage to make a promise,

35:14.900 --> 35:15.580
but not necessarily the ability

35:15.580 --> 35:16.900
to keep it.

35:19.660 --> 35:20.100
Son.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.380
The results of Mathematical Olympiad came out.

35:23.730 --> 35:24.570
You got the first place in the exam.

35:29.030 --> 35:30.210
You did a good job.

35:31.090 --> 35:31.970
Really good.

35:34.140 --> 35:34.840
A school in Haicheng

35:34.860 --> 35:36.220
has contacted me.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.340
They want you to skip a grade

35:38.960 --> 35:40.120
and go to junior high.

35:41.250 --> 35:42.520
And the school also promised

35:44.370 --> 35:45.350
to give you a scholarship.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.460
It is a great opportunity.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.070
Change your last name

35:54.860 --> 35:55.500
to mine.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.570
I've already thought of a name for you.

36:00.110 --> 36:00.890
Xiao Yuhe.

36:02.140 --> 36:02.930
What do you think?

36:06.510 --> 36:07.530
I won’t change my name.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.580
I contacted the teacher

36:09.700 --> 36:10.580
to report with you.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.230
I don't want to change my name, skip a grade,

36:13.260 --> 36:14.180
or transfer to another school.

36:15.790 --> 36:17.350
Mom, I don't want to transfer to another school.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.350
I want to stay here.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.460
This is the first time

36:20.460 --> 36:21.580
I have made a decision for myself.

36:23.430 --> 36:24.280
At that moment,

36:24.660 --> 36:25.740
I felt like

36:25.740 --> 36:26.850
I was a valiant knight,

36:28.030 --> 36:29.600
fighting the whole world

36:30.100 --> 36:31.290
to protect the precious treasure.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.240
But soon I found out that

36:35.660 --> 36:37.510
the agreement to be a good friend for a lifetime

36:38.610 --> 36:40.870
that was extremely precious to me

36:41.450 --> 36:42.650
was so cheap

36:43.370 --> 36:44.490
with Su Chengcheng.

36:46.140 --> 36:47.900
Here, let’s go.

37:25.890 --> 37:26.420
Hello, everyone.

37:26.780 --> 37:27.910
This is our new classmate.

37:28.220 --> 37:29.670
His name is Xiao Yuhe.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.660
I hid back to my high wall,

37:32.550 --> 37:33.360
but I felt something

37:33.390 --> 37:34.600
I had never felt before...

37:34.880 --> 37:35.560
Help him if you can.

37:36.230 --> 37:36.720
Loneliness.

37:37.140 --> 37:37.810
Sit there.

37:37.830 --> 37:39.250
I left quietly

37:39.740 --> 37:40.700
without saying goodbye to her.

37:40.820 --> 37:41.380
Today’s topic

37:41.620 --> 37:42.380
is mainly about...

37:42.400 --> 37:43.540
I continued to

37:44.140 --> 37:44.980
execute my life plan

37:44.980 --> 37:46.520
as meticulously as a robot.

37:47.650 --> 37:49.260
I have always followed my mother's arrangement,

37:50.320 --> 37:50.960
including

37:51.570 --> 37:52.430
writing with my right hand.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.150
e and f.

37:59.970 --> 38:00.650
Now it’s needed

38:01.580 --> 38:02.620
the value

38:03.260 --> 38:03.800
of b.

38:03.820 --> 38:05.900
a plus d equals to b.

38:15.670 --> 38:17.140
But there seems to be another me

38:17.530 --> 38:18.940
who can't help but think of her.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.430
Will she remember me?

38:21.250 --> 38:22.550
Will she be mad at me

38:23.080 --> 38:23.560
for leaving without saying goodbye?

38:24.260 --> 38:25.260
Will she make an appointment with others

38:25.740 --> 38:27.200
to be good friends for a lifetime

38:27.550 --> 38:29.160
as easily as before?

38:29.700 --> 38:30.010
No.

38:30.620 --> 38:31.590
I can't think about her.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.430
I have always been the best student.

38:33.810 --> 38:34.360
I will always remember

38:34.820 --> 38:36.160
this lesson.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.190
Don't trust Su Chengcheng.

38:41.640 --> 38:42.590
I didn't expect

38:43.090 --> 38:44.100
to meet her again that day.

38:45.340 --> 38:46.920
She is still as risible as before,

38:47.820 --> 38:48.720
like a sun.

39:03.100 --> 39:03.710
At that moment,

39:04.540 --> 39:05.820
I forgot the warnings to myself

39:05.820 --> 39:06.730
for so many years.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.470
I approached her with trepidation,

39:10.800 --> 39:11.800
guessing her first words

39:12.190 --> 39:13.790
after our reunion.

39:24.340 --> 39:25.360
Watch out.

39:26.420 --> 39:26.960
Are you okay?

39:26.990 --> 39:27.470
Yes.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.430
I didn't expect that the way she looked at me

39:33.540 --> 39:35.220
was completely like looking at a stranger.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.280
We are almost there.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.210
Let's go to the back door.

39:44.490 --> 39:45.380
So many people.

39:53.180 --> 39:53.730
It turned out that

39:54.630 --> 39:55.860
her appearance was just to

39:55.890 --> 39:57.160
prove that truth again.

39:59.150 --> 40:00.510
Never trust Su Chengcheng.
